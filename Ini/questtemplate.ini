2	Welcome to Anchorville	The Human Village	Anchorville; Rembrandt	1		1				1			<Village Chief> Rembrandt	<Village Chief> Rembrandt				Welcome, voyager. From far across the ocean, you have come. The land in which you have set foot is Anchorville. Do you know why it is so named? This is the village founded when our tribesmen first dropped anchor on the Chantra continent. That anchor has long been the symbol of our village, and is kept safe somewhere in the village. The anchor means the world to us. Do you want to take a look? If you destroy five Green Worms for us right outside the gate, I will think about it.	Easy. Destroy five Green Worms.	Good job. You are very talented. Anchorville always welcomes a wanderer like you. I will show you the symbol of Anchorville as I promised. Wait one second.						450	Green Worm	5																																1. Destroy five Green Worms.	4	2.

There is a hole in the bottom of the box. Someone must have dug a tunnel underneath. The guard, Yuan, was patrolling the area. We'd better ask him. Ask Yuan, west of the south gate, if he saw anything.	Ask the guard, Yuan, just west of the south gate.	The chief sent you here? What? The Anchor Chest disappeared? Good Heavens! What are we going to do? This is terrible! We have to figure out what to do!																																								1.

They aren't smart enough to do that on purpose, but they instinctively dig tunnels. Whatever the cause, we need to destroy those worms and retrieve the box. Hunt the Green Worms, then find the anchor box, and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village. test	The box containing the anchor is very important to us, but it might dissolve inside a Green Worm's stomach. Before that happens, catch the Green Worms, find the anchor box, and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	What an embarrassment! You have averted a great tragedy. Losing this box would have meant the end of this village. You want me to show you the anchor now? I can't do that. The anchor box is firmly locked with a spell, no one has ever seen inside the box. What I promised to show you was just the box itself. Well, I have saved face thanks to you. Welcome again to Anchorville!			1407	Chest Containing Anchor	1	450	Green Worm		1407	Chest Containing Anchor	30	1																												1.

They sprang on me so fiercely I had to retreat without even having a chance to use my weapons. I need to heal my wounds, but the Yellow Worms bit off my bag that holds my healing potions, so I don't have any right now. I have no spare potions at home, either. I'm sorry to ask, but will you give me two Small Life Potions? I will drink one and save the other for later.	You're a traveler, so you must know how precious the potion of life is. Don't be stingy. I need two Small Life Potions. Will you generously share?	Thank you. One should do the trick for now... Finally, my bleeding has stopped and the wound is healing. Thank you so much!			190	Small Life Potion	2																																			1. Get two Small Life Potions.	11	2.

It was because of this thing. The Yellow Worm discovered it while digging in the ground. It was rolling it around like a ball. I took it with me because it seemed to be too precious to be left with a creature that does not know its worth. But I don't know anything about it either. Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village knows a lot about the village and its history, and I say we should go ask him. If you have time, deliver the relic of Anchorville to him.	Not all adventurers are good at archeology. People like me enjoy finding wealth or adventure. But things like this seem precious on the surface. So, show the Relics of Anchorville to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	Not all adventurers are good at archaeology. People like me enjoy finding wealth or adventure.

Are you a thief just like other people? Umm, that's why. Kauman is an adventurer but he doesn't have enough knowledge. I wonder how many people in this village would be interested in the history of Anchorville.

It's part of the funeral treasure. It was first found when we established Anchorville, but the villagers buried it when their ancestors were buried. I don't know what it was used for, but one thing is certain. We must return it to our ancestors' tomb. I am the only one who knows the location, so I should go, but I'm too weak to conquer the monsters. So, please help me. What I need you to do is destroy five Yellow Worms outside the south gate of the village and let me carry the relic out safely.	Although this may not seem like much of a quest, I can't ask a novice traveler like you to try anything larger. It would be enough if you could destroy five Yellow Worms outside the south gate of the village.	They are really violent, but I managed to succeed thanks to you. Anchorville has always valued tradition and we need to keep it that way. I hope you respect this while you stay here.						452	Yellow Worm	5																																1.

I have a quest for you. No, don't refuse.  I am grateful that you are willing to help me. Nothing big, but recently, the Magic Stone at the western sea appeared above the surface as the sand covering it was washed away, and now the Green Molds are trying to bury it. The Magic Stone protects Anchorville from sea monsters. The monsters are instictively repelled by the Magic Stone. That is why the Molds are digging at it like crazy. So, destroy five Green Molds near the Pioneer's Road. Don't be so nonchalant.	You look lazy. What are you doing? Hurry up! Just destroy five Green Molds near the Pioneer's Road.	Good job. Wasn't that a simple quest? The Magic Stone along the seashore was established by our ancestors. There are several other Magic Stones in various places.  One is the work of the famous Nathan Manas, though we don't know exactly where it is. The story says he used it when he fought over this village with Knozen, a Sea Dragon. Don't go far. I might have other quests for you.						648	Green Mold	5																																1. Destroy five Green Molds.	4	2.

A deer dug up and took away a Magic Stone, and according to the rumors, it was Nathan's Magic Stone. The defensive power of that Magic Stone protects our village so this is a dangerous situation indeed. Find and take down the Deer and retrieve Anchorville's Magic Stone. We don't know which deer took the stone, so you'll need to just defeat them until you find the right one. The deer are usually found south outside the village.	I was so focused on Green Molds that I overlooked other dangers. Oh, those monsters! We need to chain them together and throw them in the sea. Well, take down the Deer south outside the village and retrieve the Magic Stone.	Oh, this is the Magic Stone? This is the first time I've seen it in person... Well. You've done a great job.			1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	1	10	Deer		1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	30	1																												1. Take down the Deer and retrieve Anchorville's Magic Stone.	3	2.

No doubt the magician knows a lot about these kinds of things. Go to Magic Trainer Jin Tonik, west of the village. Show him this Magic Stone and tell him what happened. He will take care of it.	I don't have any interest in magic whatsoever. It's boring. So, show this Magic Stone to Magic Trainer Jin Tonik west of the village.	I was feeling a major change in the magical forces, and I realized it was because of the Magic Stone. If you don't put the Magic Stone back where it belongs, the defensive wall of the village will weaken gradually. Someone has to do something. Me? Hohoho. Is that something for an old man to do?			1299	Anchorville Magic Stone	1																																			1.

But this Magic Stone has the power of fire, so a special job is needed to seal it under the land. According to ancient records, Nathan Manas did it by making a sacrifice at the time. The sacrifice was five Deer. You must do this as well. I will carry out the ritual to rebury the Magic Stone, and you can go outside the south gate of the village and kill five Deer.	Sacrifice objects vary from time to time. Sometimes it might be a bird flying in the air, and sometimes it might be a fish jumping out of the water. In this case, the sacrifice is five Deer. I will carry out the ritual to rebury the Magic Stone, and you can go outside the south gate of the village and destroy five Deer.	Good job. I was wondering if you can also feel the protective wall regaining power. Anchorville is a village that relies on the power of its ancestors and heroes, from ancient times to the present day.

It is the day that we put Burning Eye into a long, long sleep. You wonder what Burning Eye is? It is the name of a Huge Moth that appears east of the village. Because it has great magical power, the Alchemists regard it as a great research subject. But the thing is, the Moth rises again after two years, and we thought there must be a good reason behind this phenomenon. Recently a record was found about the Burning Eye at Delfaras. I paid a huge sum to get that record, but again, the problem was that there were a lot of monsters on the way. The record will come through a land route, not a seaway. So, clear the road by destroying five Huge Moths near the Haunted Tavern.	I really want to know about the Burning Eye. So, clear the road by destroying five Huge Moths near the Haunted Tavern.

He barely escaped, but he was able to hide the record among the rocks. I think you have to go and find it. Fetch the Record of Burning Eye under the rock near the Pioneer's Path.	Things are all screwed up because of those idiots. Fetch the Record on Burning Eye from under the rock near the Pioneer's Road.	This is the record. Let's see. Oh, the seal is too tight to open. I will have to wait until I have a candle. Let's see. What does it say.. You, go over there for a while.																				126091413	1369	Record on Burning Eye	1																	1.

That's what this says! One of the villagers annoyed the Wind Elemental and was about to get killed, he sacrificed his body to save his soul. He did not die, instead he was turned into a Huge Moth. Unless the Elemental allows him to change, he has to live in this form for eternity. This is far from Alchemy. Something's not right about this. We need to check it out. Go to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village who knows the history of Anchorville well.	The record is so far from what I had expected that it makes me tired. Go to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village and check this out.	The story about Burning Eye? There is definitely a story about Burning Eye. The hunting of the Burning Eye is done under my orders, because that is the only way to let the soul of Burning Eye rest for a while. Once it dies, it can rest for two years until it is reborn.

Now, don't attach much meaning to the name. I hope you can enjoy the festival as well, but I have one worry. Before we start the festival, we have a ritual of spreading Mana Potion around the village, in hopes that nothing bad will happen. But we're short on Mana Potion as some jars were broken along the way this year. I feel uncomfortable going ahead with the festival without it. So, get me three Small Mana potions.	I don't think anything catastrophic would happen just because we're missing a couple of Mana potions. But spreading the potion is also a part of our tradition, and if something bad happens without spreading the potion, I will be guilt stricken. So please get me three Small Mana Potions.	Thank you.

I have a plan to restore the building into a prosperous establishment, but in order to attract travelers, we need to find out how much evil is in the building. It's been about a year since I attached the special talisman there. The talisman carries the records of the evil spirits surrounding the place over the last year. It is about time we recover the talisman, and I believe you're the one for that quest. Please recover the Archaic Talisman attached on the Remains of the Haunted Tavern.	It may be because I like to drink, but the Haunted Tavern seems like a dream to me. It is important to me. Recover the Tattered Talisman in the Remains of the Haunted Tavern as soon as possible.

Recently, a boar we called Big Rage wandered through the village and ruined all the crops and fields. He must have been on the losing side of a fight in some other boar's territory. Well, the village has suffered greatly because of this boar, so prove yourself by defeating the Boar Big Rage southeast of the village, or on the hill east of the Haunted Tavern.	It was about a year ago your teacher came to this village, about the time Big Rage came. So he knows about Big Rage, but does he know it's still alive? Well, defeat the Boar Big Rage on the hill east of the Haunted Tavern.	Oh, you caught it! Great job! Your teacher wrote on the Letter that if you defeat Big Rage, it proves that you have met his expectations. You are indeed a superb traveler.						673	Big Rage	1																																1.

But the port they can bring their ship into is full of Maryliths. I want to oust them somehow, but no one wants to help gamblers. Villagers hate them because they might spoil the village atmosphere. If it is okay with you, I would like you to help me. You will? Thank you. Then I will tell you the first step of my 3-step Plan! Find and bring back Maryliths' Jar inside the tent of Marylith Village on the Pioneer's Road.	Don't ignore my perfect three-step Plan! Just do what I say, and bring back Maryliths' Jar from inside the tent in Marylith village on the Pioneer's Road.	Ah yes, this is it. This is Maryliths' Jar. It is not what I expected. I heard that Marylith holds this thing sacred. I don't know why because no one in this village knows much about Maryliths. Well, thank you for your efforts. What? You want to know why Marylith regard this jar so highly? I don't know.																				126091770	1540	Marylith's Jar	1																	1.

Your curiousity about that makes me curious too. Go see Adventurer Kauman at the city center and ask him about the jar.	Truthfully speaking, I'd consider selling this jar if it were valuable, but it just looks like an ordinary jar, so It's not worth it. We do need to satisfy our curiosity, though. Go to Adventurer Kauman at the city center and ask him about the jar.	What? Someone took the Maryliths' Jar? The swine. That jar is where Maryliths keep their eggs. And their chicks have deadly poison, so if you're bitten, it can be a fatal wound. I need to send someone right now and find out about it. Was it Holly, the safe keeper?																																								1. Ask Adventurer Kauman of Anchorville about the Jar.																														10	110	31	Poison and Antidote
31	Taming Marylith	Poison and Antidote	Anchorville; Kauman	1		7				1	30	Secret of the Jar	<Adventurer> Kauman	<Safe Keeper> Holly				I knew it. It looks like Maryliths are born out of the jar she brought. What are you going to do? If we don't do anything, she'll die because of the poison. Fortunately, the poison of a Young Marylith is not as deadly. We can cure her with an ordinary antidote. One Potion will be enough. Use whatever method, and get one bottle of Antidote Potion for Safe Keeper Holly, northwest of the village. Either buy it or get it from a monster	Although the poison is not deadly, if we don't do something, the nerve cells will die, and she will not be able to use her arms and legs. Are you going to leave her like that? If not, get a bottle of Antidote Potion for Safe Keeper Holly, northwest of the village! Either get it from a monster or buy it.	Thank you, you saved me. I didn't know what would be inside the jar. A chick? One was born, but I crushed it when it bit me. Even when I think of it now, it hurts. By the way, what should I do? I heard the Maryliths are really angry. I guess I should not go to the seaside for a while. By the way, what happened to my friends? I need to find out.			191	Antidote Potion	1																																			1. Get one bottle of Antidote Potion.	11	2.

Because of this jar, the Maryliths are full of poison, and my friends' ship has landed. They are weak fighters because all they do is gamble. Can I ask you a favor? Please destroy fifteen Maryliths at the Pioneer's Road so my friends can run away.	If anyone gets hurt, they will resent me forever and say they will not gamble with me anymore. Then I would have nobody to rely on in this big city. So please destroy fifteen Maryliths at the Pioneer's Road.	Thanks to you, they were able to safely get away, but they sent me a fire signal that they will never come back to this village. Hrmph. This is not my fault.

And the letter carried the same message. So it's your destiny to stop the Golden Path from opening. There's not much more in the letter, but it does say we need to defeat the monsters one by one to stop those who want to open the Golden Path. One by one, hmm. This also seems to indicate a Goblin Scout Tongtong, at Scout's Land, probably has another Letter. Steal that Letter from him.	I thought the monsters were up to something. Well, it looks like the Goblin Scout Tongtong, at the Scouting Site, has a Letter. Steal that Letter from him.	Good job. Goblin Scout Tongtong was building a small village there. If we had let him be, another Goblin Base would have appeared. It's fortunate we stopped that.

The Goblin Scout Tongtong and  Marylith Switch are two totally different tribes, but according to this letter, they have formed an alliance. It is written in monsters' letters, but I learned to read it to open the Golden Gate. Indeed, your teacher was right. Well, the alliance is not good news for us. Defeat the Marylith Switch at the Pioneer's Road.	In the long run, this is for the good of Humans. Still, for the time being, defeat the Marylith Switch at the Pioneer's Road.	Good job.

To get it, use your Ransacking skill on the Goblin Guards in the Goblin Valley.	If you are cooperating with the Goblin Rangers, you will not behead them. So, in order to prove yourself innocent, bring me one Goblin's Head. You can get it by using your Ransacking skills on the Goblin Guards in the Goblin Valley.	Yes, this is a Goblin's Head.

I think I  need you to do me a favor. Get to know the villagers and find out who the culprit is. Personally, I suspect Magic Trainer Gin Tonic. Someone saw him with monsters. Go to Jin Tonik west of the village, and ask him about it.	Go to the Magic Trainer Jin Tonik, who's west of the village, and ask him if he has been secretly communicating with the monsters.	Oh, I've been found out. Yes, I teamed up with the Goblin Rangers but I had no other choice. I made a bet, and I owe them 50 Gold. Pay back? I don't think it's possible.

You can pay back the money to the monsters for me. I have other villagers I can borrow money from, but I don't want to be a burden to them. Rembrandt has already suffered much because of me. You are a foreigner, so you may not believe me but take fifty Gold to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village instead of giving it to me. You can believe in him. When you give him the money, tell him about me as well.	This is really a humiliating situation. I'm so embarrassed because of a mere fifty Gold. I had bad luck. So take the fifty Gold to chief Rembrandt at the center of the village, not me, to pay it back to the monsters.	I don't feel comfortable making big decisions like this one. I have to swallow my pride by going to the monsters. I have no other choice... I will go to negotiate with the monsters.		50																																						1.

We have already decided to show our military power, so nothing will change. Defeat ten Goblin Rangers at Sunrise Beach or at Goblin Valley. Those who are terrified will surrender.	No words are needed. Defeat ten Goblin Rangers at Sunrise Beach or at the Goblin Valley.	Thanks to you, little damage was done to our village, and we earned some income.

I think he has eyes in the back of his head. He knows what we've been doing so far. Before he left this town, he found out someone had given the documents to open the Golden Path to the monsters. He went after the betrayer and wants you to find the documents. But he didn't leave any clues to where the document is, so we asked a hunter to find the location. According to the hunter, it's inside the Goblin Basin, but he's not sure where. If you destroy twenty Goblin Guards at the Goblin Basin, the hunter said he'll find the document. When you've succeeded, go to Adventurer Kauman at the center of the village.	He's prepared as well. Go to Adventurer Kauman at the center of the village after you destroy twenty Goblin Guards in the Goblin Basin.	Oh, we have totally missed the point. Did you do what the chief asked? Your hunting skills were not that bad, but your efforts were in vain. Do not give up? What are you talking about? Giving up is not in Adventurer Kauman's vocabulary. Wait a moment.

Rockpick, a Young Redspine Wolf, lives on Sunrise Beach. What I got right was it is the Goblins that received the suspicious document. But the document was moved to where Rockpick lives under the Goblin Chief's order. Rockpick is being raised by the Goblin Chief. The monsters played it smart, but they cannot evade my information network. The document to open the Gold Road you are looking for is in the rocks of Sunrise Beach. Find the document and take it to Chief Rembrandt in the center of the village.	If you don't hurry, the monsters may find it. Then you'll have to double your efforts. Find the document to open the Golden Path at the rock of Sunrise Beach and take it to Chief Rembrandt at the center of the village.	This is the document to open the Golden Path! But I can't read it. This is neither an ancient language nor an Elemental language. Although I can't truly read it, I can understand a little. But, what language do the monsters know? Could it be the Language of Darkness that is no longer used these days? It's interesting yet makes me uneasy. I will keep this for the time being until we find a solution.

Well, that's why, I don't have an answer I can give to the chief. If it is okay with you, could you give the answer to the chief?

Oh, you've defeated Midas! As Midas was at the center of the ritual, with his death, the ritual has failed. Good job. But the celebration is short lived.

When Delfaras was being built, our tribe sealed the place once again, keeping our promise with the Sea People. Recently, I heard something strange from Pilgram Nox who is studying there. Go to Nox.	He does not guard that place but he has been managing it for a long time. He is also a good friend of my father's. Well, go to Pilgrim Nox at the Jamushi's Seal.	Oh, you are the one with the Contract Symbol. The Mayor has an eye for assessing someone's worth. Take a break and listen to what I say.																																								1.

This happened after a Young Lycanto named Rojin appeared. Rojin is clearly different from other Young Lycantos. He has a strong and clear goal. Well, destroying Jamushi's Seal will not be an easy quest, but it is indeed troubling me. Defeat ten Young Lycantos east of Jamushi's Seal.	It's no use talking a lot. We must drive them away by defeating ten Young Lycantos east of the Jamushi's Seal.	They all ran off in chaos! You did a better job than we expected. Great work! But don't go yet.

We need to ask for repair at Delfaras, but we have to make one thing clear. It doesn't make sense to repair Jamushi's Seal with Delfaras' budget when it is the Young Lycantos that destroyed the place. I have a good idea. I know where Young Lycanto Rojin hid his money. I heard he received a money pouch with a thousand Gold and hid it. I think it's okay for us to use that money. Steal the Thousand Gold Pouch under the rock near Triangle Village.	Regardless of the reason, stealing is not good, so I would pay for the cost if I could. For a random wanderer a day's pay would be enough. However, I do not have enough money. So, steal the Gold Pouch under the rock near Triangle Village.	Good job! Lycanto have their own culture, so they need money too. It's not strange for them to keep money, but there are rumors that someone gave them that money for a specific purpose. Perhaps the money paid for the attack on Jamushi's Seal. Well, we need to take some things to Delfaras including this money, so hold on a second.																				132711129	1195	1000 Gold Pouch	1																	1.

There are signs the Young Lycantos who lost their money pouch are heading this way. In particular, this time, their Leader Rojin is coordinating the attack. He's very cunning. I cannot stay here any longer. This may become a bigger problem later on, so let's root out this issue now. Go east of the Jamushi's Seal and defeat the Young Lycanto Rojin.	Rojin clearly has different powers than other Young Lycantos. We need to be extremely careful. Go east of the Jamushi's Seal and defeat Young Lycanto Rojin.	It is said Pilgrims shouldn't kill, but there are things more important than mere words. I hope that there will be peace in the Jamushi's Seal for the time being.

A few days ago I was talking to Mathematician Centergoras and he said if I see someone like you, send that person to him. You definitely match his description. Centergoras told me you will be my partner in a small adventure. I had high expectations, but you look too young. Oh, I take it back. I'm sorry! Anyway, go to Mathematician Centergoras southwest of the city.	He showed great interest in you, so he must be eager to meet you. Go to the Mathematician Centergoras southwest of the city.	You're the one I was waiting for. To be more clear, your teacher was waiting for you. Haha. Your teacher and I are old friends. We've known each other since we began training.

While I was here, I searched for one thing - Zian's Proof. I've never seen it, but it was something Zian Manas created before he died. Your teacher should have given it to me, but instead he buried the Proof here for you to find. Start with the Torn Map under the rock near Triangle Village, and take it to Guard Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city. He will be your companion for this short journey.	The map will probably show where Zian's Proof is. I don't know anything more specific than that. So, find the Torn Map under the rock near Triangle Village, and take it to Guard Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	Are you back? Is Centergoras well? What is this map? Let me see. Hmm, interesting. Because of the torn part, I can't see it all, but there are all sorts of symbols. For military purposes, I take great interest in maps, so things like this really interest me. I don't know what Nox meant, but it seems you've been given a grand quest. Good. I'll help you.

He's from a minor tribe, and I have known him for ages, but this time he seems to be really angry. Would you go check on him? That's miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnomes' Cave.	I'm not totally sure, but it seems when the tribe's reputation has been hurt or insulted the Gnomes get very angry. Don't you think it's  something like that?

First of all, we need to find the King's treasure, defeat the Fire Lycantos and bring back King Miriman's Treasure. The Lycantos are probably near Triangle Village.	Of course, we should take responsibility for being so foolish, but it's more urgent to find the treasure. Defeat the Fire Lycantos near Triangle Village and bring back King Miriman's Treasure.

I think the Sacred Sacrifice is totally useless to Fire Lycantos, so it may seem strange to them that we are eager to find it.

The coach was destroyed and most of the soldiers were killed. But most of the Lizardmen Soldiers also died and the rest escaped. We were able to evacuate what was left of our soldiers to the cave, but the Gold Nugget Chest was left at the seashore. The soldiers hid it there so it wouldn't be stolen.

One Life Potion is enough to save one person, and this is the total amount that we need. The more the better, but at the moment we only need one bottle of Medium Life Potion. Bring it to me.

I first heard about it from my grandmother. Zian's Proof was prepared by Zian Manas in the event of his death. Zian lived alone, and did not have any descendants.

This is because Zian Manas stayed in this Gypsy Village for about six months. He might have hidden the Proof at that time. And the Lizardmen regard that Proof as sacred. This may not make sense to you, but it is nevertheless true. They are guarding a treasure. The problem is where it's hidden... we don't have a map. We need to find it from a story my grandmother vaguely told me about long ago. You don't know this place well, so I'll check the location first.

He won't let you down.	You have disturbed my valuable experiment. You're very brazen. Why are you here? Hmm... this talisman exudes evil, the power of the Earth.  Where did you find this? Is that right? This is interesting. How does anyone dare use this talisman at Limelight? I take this as a challenge against me, the great Jeriad. I will take the challenge.

That's why it's more difficult to solve. The Alchemy used in this talisman is different from that used these days. But who am I? I am Alchemist Jeriad! I can do whatever I want. I know everything about this primitive magic. Do you know the traits of primitive magic? It uses raw materials gained easily in everyday life. We need those raw materials to decrypt this talisman. You, go get two Cave Mushrooms. You can buy them from the cook. The Cave Mushrooms pull away the power of the Earth, so it can lessen the power in this talisman.	It is an error to disregard the power of alchemy, but it is wrong to overestimate its power as well. After all, it's belief that determines one's power. It does not matter what raw material we use. Get two Cave Mushrooms. You can buy them from the cook.	Did you bring them? You've done a great job. It may have been difficult, but it should be a rewarding experience. Exactly two, right? I was worried you might eat them on your way back. These mushrooms taste great. Well, wait a moment.			638	Cave Mushroom	2																																			1.

At first sight, it looks like one jewel, but this is a sophisticated piece of work. The outside and inside are separated by a very thin layer. I want to meet the person who has such superb skills. Well. In order to know what's written on it, we need to grind this side of the Jewel, but metal tools will only break it. The best way is to grind it with another jewel named the Earth's Eye. This jewel forms when the power of the Earth Elemental crystalizes. It's different from the Elemental Stone. No one knows how it came into being. On the outside, it's glossy, but it's opaque and has a rough surface if you split it right. It's the best tool for delicate work because it doesn't wear away. The Earth's Eyes are usually found under the rocks near Anchorville. Find an Earth's Eye under a rock and bring it back to me.	Don't forget, we can't do anything without the Earth's Eye.

The monsters on the way may make it difficult. So defeat eight Magic Lykantos near Triangle Village. Don't come back to me, but go to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.

I don't know how Ingo got it, but that's not important. In order to make the ring visible, we need to use the secret potion passed on in Alchemy books. To make that secret potion, we need to go to a particular place to collect raw materials, but there are lots of Silver Lycantos there now. I'm an alchemist, not a fighter. I need someone to keep those Lycantos away. I heard you're powerful though, so defeat six Silver Lycantos in front of the King's Bridge. I will collect raw materials in the meantime.	You can't understand me? If you cannot defeat six Silver Lycantos, I may die. Go to the King's Bridge and complete your quest right away.	I managed to get the raw materials, but I'm hurt.

According to the records, he toured Limelight in his later years, and he went to Gypsy Town after coming to the Miracle Spring, then crossed the bridge to return to Tullan. I think there is a high possibility that my assumption is right. There is also a place in the Miracle Spring that holds a separate record. I think it is better to go there. Go to the Miracle Spring and ask Pilgrim Canaria.	Moreover, there are rumors that something bad is happening near the Miracle Fountain, so go and check it out. Go to the Miracle Spring and ask Pilgrim Canaria about it.	You have come from Delfaras. I was waiting for you. How did I know? the Miracle Spring is loved by the Water Elemental.

The Water Elemental told me that as well. The Proof you're looking for is in the Fountain, but you don't know why Zian's Proof is so significant. This Proof is the line between Good and Evil. Zian got it after fighting Black Mine Bultak at Black Mountain. Zian Manas wanted to destroy that Proof, but he had to leave that responsibility to following generations. He buried the Proof here in Miracle Spring, and hoped somebody would find it and destroy it. Yes, you have that opportunity. But before you find the Proof, you have to go through a test created by Zian Manas. Defeat the Young Torge Gasios at Silent Forest.	Gasios is the envoy of the Elementals Zian sent through a magician. Gasios guards the place and tests people who come for the Proof. You must defeat Young Torge Gasios in Silent Forest.	You have defeated Gasios. You have certainly passed Zian's test.

According to the last chapter of the records Zian left in the Fountain, The day the Proof is destroyed, the God of Death will appear again. That will be the last ordeal. Remember what I said. Take Zian's Proof to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of Delfaras Castle. He can help.	You can't solve this problem by yourself. The answer can be found in the magical city of Delfaras. Take the Zian's Proof to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of Delfaras Castle.	Is this Zian's Proof? Umm, Zian left those words? I have lived here for a long time, but I didn't know the story behind all this. I think heroes are quite different from us in their abilities. As Canaria said, this city is a magician's city.

I was planning to give some spices to Caravan Goldilocks, but water leaked into the warehouse and ruined my stock of seasonings.  I already told him that would be his share and if I don't honor my word, I'll be in deep trouble. So I'm asking you to get some more for me. I planned on giving Goldilocks one bottle of Spicy Seasoning. You can probably buy it from the cook.	This week is almost over, so if you're late, I'll get into serious trouble.

She borrowed the Seasoning from me and lost it! Even though you brought it to me, I will make her repay me for it. Go to Merchant Sydney at Triangle Village and ask her for compensation.	Triangle Village is not in Delfaras, so the merchants there will not be worried. For instance, Sydney is completely at ease even though she lost the Seasoning. So, go to Merchant Sydney in Triangle Village and ask her for compensation.	I knew Bleth would someday send someone about the Seasoning. It's just that I really needed it and I couldn't get it from anywhere else....I think I dropped it in front of the King's Bridge. Oh, what's that? She wants some kind of compensation?

He carved his signature on it so that no one would steal it. It is really precious and valuable. At the moment, Goblin Scouts are guarding the Wine Bottle, and I believe you can steal it with your power.

The proof Bultac has in Black Mountain was a bridge linking the present world with the underworld. As long as you have Zian's Proof, you can move from the world of the dead to that of the living, and vise versa. It is thus the most powerful object on earth! Zian's Proof can only be destroyed by the dead.  You and I aren't  dead, so we can't do anything. However, I did ask the knowledgeable Adventurer Iva what he thinks. Maybe he found out something.  Go to Adventurer Iva southwest of the city.	Iva has been on many adventures, and he might be able to shed some light on this subject. Go to Adventurer Iva southwest of the city.	I heard about you from Commander Marco. I did go to Black Mountain once but I didn't know anything about what happened there a hundred years ago.

It all started when you brought back Zian's Proof. So I searched some records and found out Zian Manas was related to Delfaras' famous Mercenary Commander Victor, and after Zian retrieved the proof, Victor attacked Zian to steal it.  He ultimately failed and ended up dying with all his troops. When the Black Power of Northern Land spread across the continent, Victor was reborn as a Skeleton Commander. So this is a sign that the Vengeful Spirit reacted to the proof. While I was reading these documents, something came to mind. I have a task for you. Find the Yellow Magic Jewel among the remains of the Haunted Tavern. It will be useful.	I heard Skeletons are coming out of the Vengeful Basin. Are you going to wait for them to attack this city? Quick, find the Yellow Magic Jewel from among the remains of the Haunted Tavern.	The Yellow Magic Jewel was extracted from the skull of a corpse. It was used to erase all memories the dead had of this world and blocked them from approaching.

I'll hide Zian's Proof and the Yellow Magic Jewel inside your armor. If the dead are not going to willingly destroy the proof, the only other way is to force them into destroying it. Victor is the only one with enough power to destroy the proof, so you must fight him head to head and get him to attack you. Only an able person like you can do it. Don't worry. The Chief and I have already taken care of other issues. A sufficient number of soldiers will have your back. All you have to do is go to the Vengeful Basin and defeat Skeleton Commander Victor.  As soon as you confirm Zian's Proof is destroyed, go report to Commander Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	The chief will be very happy as well. Go to the Vengeful Basin, defeat the Skeleton Commander Victor, and report the situation to Chief Marco in front of the east gate of the city.	When I first heard about the plan from Iva, I thought it was terrible. But I think he came up with it because he believes in your courage and ability. Thanks to your dedication and efforts, a dangerous object has been destroyed.

The city sent me a letter ordering me to visit. But since I am busy at the moment, I'd like you to go find out why. Go to Safe Keeper Himena southeast of Delfaras Plaza, and ask why she wanted me to come.	I can't think of a reason she might be asking for me. Go to Safe Keeper Himena, just southeast of Delfaras Plaza, and ask her why she wanted me to come.	You came instead of Sydney? I didn't say to send someone else. What? She asked you to ask me why I told her to come? She is so brazen. How can she feign innocence? You don't seem to know, so I will tell you the story. A while ago, a customer said that Lizardmen Thieves stole a map from him. According to his words, the map indicated three nearby locations where treasures were buried. I happened to tell the story to Sydney, and she seemed uninterested. But this time, she caught the Lizardmen, found the map, and dug up one of the treasures. That map belonged to my customer. If she found a treasure, she should have returned it! I knew she was bold, but this is way too much. I need to think of countermeasures. She would never return the treasure nicely.																																								1. Go to the Safe Keeper Himena in Delfaras.																														210	1390	112	Explosive Document

I'll go settle this issue once and for all! I'll go see how brazen she can be when we talk face to face. But there is one worry. I told my relative I would get him Crossbow Bolts for protection, but if I go do that, Sydney might take all the treasures. So while I go to Triangle Village to meet her, can you get me a thousand Bolts? There are plenty of ways to get them.	My relative is skillful with crossbows, but if the bolts run out during his travels, it might be dangerous for him. So he needs as many bolts as he can carry. He's strong enough to carry a lot. Please get me a thousand Bolts for his safe journey.	Phew, I'm back. Are you back already? We were both fast. My hair? Oh, don't worry about it. We didn't get into a cat fight. No, we didn't.

I just hope he will be able to finish his quest in the meantime.	Truthfully speaking, the person needing the Bolts is not my relative, but my customer. I'm sorry I had to lie to you. But I needed to keep the secret. Well, go to the Warrior Plains and destroy ten Death Eyeballs.	Good job! My customer was able to find the other two treasures after a few minor problems.

Quick, go to Miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnomes' Cave and talk to him.	Welcome. I have heard about you. I heard you can solve many things, is that right? I have high expectations. What do I need? Yes, yes, I didn't explain yet. Listen to me carefully. My ancestors made a Hundred Swords for heroes a long time ago, but as time went by, most disappeared and now only two remain.

One of the Hundred Swords was passed down in the Black Manas family. After Nathan Manas sealed Brumhart, Jian Manas used it. Another of the Hundred Swords was owned by Radeus III and given to Tullan's Martin Regen. That sword was never used. It was buried in the King's tomb, but was then stolen. The King's family managed to buy it back for a high price. But the sword is in danger of being stolen once again on its way here. The group carrying the sword is urgently asking for help. If you catch me twenty Scout Spiders near the Warriors' Plains, they will be able to escape.	It will be difficult for them to escape because of the Eyeballs in the area. If you destroy twenty Scout Spiders near the Warrior Plains, they will be able to escape.	Hmm, what can I do? The threat of the monsters means they've split up into two groups to travel. The group you helped escape didn't have the sword of Radeus III. We need to wait until the other group arrives.

The weapons and armor should be made of Ghoul, but I dropped the Ghoul's Fangs I'd collected into the forge, so I cannot use them anymore. Can you get me five Ghoul's Fangs?  There are no Ghouls nearby, but there are Horror Ghouls just over the bridge, north of the Old Harbor Area in Membreden. Use your Ransacking skills on them to get the fangs.	In order to win the contest, I need good materials and skill. I'm definitely more skillful than him, but if I can't get the materials, it's useless.

I guess he's putting his best effort into making the armor. This doesn't mean he's better than me. I'm just curious. Just curious, and this has nothing to do with my work. So go to Blacksmith Bolpunch in Triangle Village and see his armor. I'm just curious.	I'm not asking you to do this because I accept his skills, I'm just a bit bored and curious.

It's in the Land of Lizardman's Claw, but I don't know the exact location. If I weren't so busy, I would go search for it and give it to him. Could you do this for me?

He's busy searching for the Lost Armor. It's so important, all the castle villagers have been summoned to find it, including the guilds registered under him. Go to Guild Registrar Mohol in front of the east gate of the city.	He is strict and arrogant, but if you want to make your life comfortable here in the city, you need to get acquainted with him.

As you may already know, a Hard Cube has all kinds of weapons in its stomach. You can get one weapon each time you attack him. However, we don't have much time, and the guild members are complaining about the mission. I think you need to set an example for them so defeat ten Hard Cubes at Gotgot. Guild members will find the Lost Armor if you use your Ransacking skill on the Hard Cubes. That is the only way to make others follow in your footsteps....be their role model.	What you do is all for me. The credit for your destroying ten Hard Cubes belongs to me. Why? Does that seem unfair? But you gave me your word, so you need to do it. Go to Gotto and defeat ten Hard Cubes.	All of you went through a lot to find the Lost Greaves, but barely managed it. How pathetic. Well, still it's good we found what was assigned to us.

To cure them, a Healing Potion is needed, but at the moment, we don't have any. I think I need to use a natural remedy for the time being. Dried Meat is the best way to pull out the Hard Cube's secretion from their bodies. It will absorb the secretion because of its dryness. Bring me ten pieces of Dried Meat. You may buy it from a cook.	If we leave them like that they'll go crazy and I'll be blamed for that too. We don't need that, now do we?  Bring me ten pieces of Dried Meat. You can buy them from a cook. I know you can do it.	Get me that Dried Meat! Hurry, hurry! Phew, that was close. If we were even a second late, we might have been killed by the rebelling guild members. These days they're really violent.

Go to Alchemist Exerion, just west of the city plaza. Oh, he's like me. He doesn't do anything for anyone unless he gets paid for it. He's depressed at the moment because his most recent experiment failed. You must destroy Big Boar Yeti in Cape Goto before you visit him.	Isn't it natural for someone to expect compensation for a favor? I have never thought this was strange. Well, destroy Big Boar Yeti in Cape Gotto before you go to Alchemist Exerion just west of the city plaza.	I heard someone destroyed Largefoot, and I thought it would be you.  Until you came, there really haven't been any strong travelers here. Anyway, why did you defeat him? What do you need? The Talisman of Secret Observation? No wonder everyone is reluctant to talk about it. From an alchemist's point of view, the talisman is a very useful thing. If you bury the Talisman of Secret Observation under a rock or trees, it can spy on a wide area surrounding that point. In other words, no one's privacy is safe. So that's why adults, who have many sins, are so reluctant to talk about it.

Ellajean might ask for diplomatic help from Delfaras' Mayor, so we must act first. Go to Mayor Megara in the center of Delfaras Plaza and ask for help.	Elajins should not know anything at the moment. If they find out about our plan, I don't know how they will react. So, go to Mayor Megara in the center of Delfaras Plaza and ask for help.	Even when my father was alive our city had nothing to do with Elajin. Of course, we engaged in trade, but nothing more than that. This doesn't mean we were against Tullan.

Magicians and alchemists the world over thought it was possible without the Archons. I can't help but want to see it happen. For the magic I'm considering using, I need a thing called Flower of Curses. This is a flower growing where a hate-filled monster is buried. If I don't control the flower properly, there could be great trouble but since I am a superb mage I am planning to change the power of hatred into the power of magic. Well, even if I explain it to you in detail, you won't be able to understand. Just go and get it for me. Get the Flower of Curses from the cracks of the rock near the Warriors' Plains.

For example, there is a tree around Nocturn Yard that produces something called Life Sap. Life Sap is a miracle liquid, and if you use it while saying a sincere prayer to the Elementals, it can resuscitate dying patients.  It also brings all kinds of luck. Soldiers are ordered to collect the Life Sap every year in the city, but we can only get very small amounts every time. The River Goblin Warriors kill soldiers who come from to the city so I would like to ask you to help them. The place is near Nocturn Yard. You should first destroy ten River Goblin Warriors and then help out the soldiers collect the Life Sap.	The soldiers guarding the city are also engaged in voluntary work for the welfare of the villagers. Life Sap is not for our soldiers to use. You would be helping the whole village! Destroy ten River Goblin Warriors near Nocturn Yard.	Good job! Now all we have to do is wait for the soldiers to bring back the Life Sap.

We were able to collect Life Sap, but because of our carelessness, it became contaminated. Perhaps poison got in the sap. Even if it's not poison, the sap smells different from previous years and the color is opaque. However, we can't go collect it again. Life Sap can be extracted from the tree only once a year. According to the Alchemist, the Miracle Spring Water can purify the Sap. I need you to get one bottle of the Miracle Spring Water from Pilgrim Canaria at Miracle Spring. Not many people know the geography of that area, so I think it is better for a traveler like you to go there.	There are a few ways the sap can get contaminated. For example, if the carrier of the sap has bad intentions in his mind, or when a person with a sin touches the sap, and so on. In fact, I don't know what each soldier is up to, so there is no way to find out what happened. In the end, it's my fault because I didn't manage the soldiers properly. Please get one bottle of Miracle Spring Water from Pilgrim Canaria at Miracle Spring.	The Life Sap produced in Tullan is not for Humans. It's comes from deep within the earth to the Wind Elemental through a tree. All under the promise between the Water Elemental and the Earth Elemental. The sap can become contaminated with just a single thought of bad intentions, so you can't purify the Life Sap here with the Miracle Spring Water because it only contains the power of the Water Elemental. Don't be disappointed though. You have many other options. Wait a minute.																																								1.

But young men in the castle will remember when Usus attacked a year ago. The alliance between Humans and Orcs are now chasing Usus under an agreement they signed half a year ago.

But for some reason, he didn't use the Symbol and didn't take it back with him when he left Tullan. In other words, that Symbol is hidden somewhere in Tullan.

You should know there's a simple way to scatter Zombies. It doesn't matter how many enemies there are, but you should try defeating seven Zombie Leaders at the Shadow Grave. The number seven has magical power, so it can counteract the power of the Undead, although this method only lasts a limited time. It's one of our basic survival tactics.	Although it's for my own survival, please defeat seven Zombie Leaders at the Shadow Grave. I must have all seven, no less.	That was a close call. Thanks to you, I'm safe. The information I received from the Zombies? I will try my best to find out from now on. The Symbol was hidden for such a long time, so I can't see it unless I disperse all the curses wrapped around the Symbol. So we need to wait until the right time. Oh, you want to know why I asked you your name? A traveler from the East said he heard of the Undead's Symbol from your teacher. The traveler conveyed the message and said to engage you in the quest when you arrived at Tullan. So I just did my job. Do you understand now? Then stay quiet and wait until the next quest comes.						85	Zombie Leader	7																																1. Defeat seven Zombie Leaders at the Shadow Grave.	4	2.

Martin Regen, founder of the city, made many charms so that the Undead would not appear near the city. Although he accepted the existence of monsters, he thought the Undead didn't belong in Tullan since they were wandering between life and death. Recently, however, they appear frequently. I'm afraid this means they gained more power than Regen's charms can ward off. Collect information from villagers to help us verify the situation. Guard Arian always guards the plains, so he must know something about this. He's patrolling the south gate of the city.	Ask Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city about the appearance of the Undead around the area.	The Undead? I had many ideas, but I couldn't find any answers. And I still have no answer.

Well, we need something to replace this Magic Rock. It will be best to ask Alchemist Exerion to make something for us, but he will not help us unless we give him what he wants. In the past, I lost the Sorcerer's Scroll at Knockton Yard, and I remember Exerion was eager to get it back. Find the Scroll and give it to Exerion. You will find it between the buildings at Knocton Yard. Take it to Alchemist Exerion west near the village plaza, and ask him to make us a rock.	I also want to have that Scroll, but I don't feel bad because I gave up on having it when I lost it at Knockturn Yard. So don't you worry.

The object first appeared north of Ezerock. There's a place there called the Land of Death, and there was a Sorcerer who conquered the Undead King Tangerian. The Sorcerer took Tangerian's bones, and since then, the bones have been referred to as the Undead Symbol. The person possessing the bones can summon the authority of Tangerian at anytime and control the Undead. Scary object, huh? I still wonder why Usus didn't use it. Not only me, but many others are looking for the Undead Symbol. Go to Magic Weapons Merchant Lucia southwest of the city, and listen to what she has found out. Sharing information is not a bad idea.	She's not the only one in search of the object, but for now go to Magic Weapons Merchant Lucia southwest of the city.	You're talking about the Undead Symbol.

I don't care what anyone does to fulfill one's desires, but I can't accept this city being destroyed. Evidence? I have one thing that comes to mind. I saw them hide something at Nocturn Yard. That may be sufficient evidence. I know the location, but I can't explain it to you because Nocturn Yard is too complicated. I will find the thing they hid. You go and defeat fifteen Gargoyles. Your job is to protect me.	Don't worry. I know that it's dangerous there, but I'm not so weak I'd let them eat me. If you're that worried, just help me by defeating fifteen Gargoyles at Nocturn Yard.	It was a talisman they hid at Nocturn Yard. I know very well what this talisman is. After all, I am a Magic Weapons Merchant. This is a Talisman of Magic Perpetuation. It maintains the magical power consistently within a certain range where it's attached. Then, can't that mean the Undead's Symbol is nearby? I can only think of it that way.

This is important. Find me a Scroll of Enhanced Life on your way through Shump Village as well. Each scroll will be hidden inside different buildings.

Who are they? They are those carrying talismans in search of the Undead's Symbol. The three of us had our homes ransacked recently. They tried to make us believe it was petty thieves' work, but we knew what they were looking for. Although they haven't done anything dangerous to us up until now, we know it will become more and more dangerous if we keep it any longer. I think it's best to take it out of the village. So we decided to create a diversion. Although Aaron has it, I will pretend that I have it. We need your help in this act. I will run away as if I am trying to hide it in Low Wind Village. But, you need to go and defeat ten Ghouls east of the Shadow Grave and return quickly.	We need to act as if this is the truth. I will run as fast as I can, so you go and defeat ten Ghouls east of the Shadow Grave and return quickly.	Phew, did it go okay? Didn't they get tricked?

After the job, they demanded more money than we had originally agreed on, so I refused to pay them. Since then, they've been waiting outside the castle just to get hold of me. So I put out a bounty of three thousand Gold on their heads. I even took out an official warrant. Deliver the Warrant for Red Boar Imps to Mayor Cutty, south of the central plaza, and ask him to post it throughout the city.	If I don't get through this mess, I may not be able to continue being a safe keeper. So please deliver the Warrant for the Red Boar Imps to Mayor Cutty south of the central plaza.

Guard Arian must have seen the warrant Avlin distributed and decided to take the challenge. He said he was going to start hunting and requested a favor of me - two bottles of Cool Seasoning. I'm guessing he's going to sprinkle it on some bait to lure the Red Boars, but if the Imp is riding on his back...  Anyway, hurry up and get those to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city.	Arian's not really a skilled guard, but he does have a strong drive for success. Deliver two bottles of Cool Seasoning to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city. You can buy them from a cook.	Thank you for bringing me what I need.

My buddy says he scattered poisoned bait around the field to lure Red Boars, but Imps are no fools. They won't fall for that. Now that I give it some thought, this strategy is actually quite dangerous. He could ruin the whole thing for us. I'll have to step in this time. Bring back the Poisoned Boar Feed from the rocks near the Shadow Tombs.	Avlin didn't set any specific conditions, so it doesn't matter if we use poison. We just need to catch them. But we need to be careful because we could lose both our honor and our bounty. Bring back the Poisoned Boar Feed from the rocks near the Shadow Grave.	Oh, what a relief! That's good news.

I was charmed for a while and he took my Gold Dust Pouch. I was planning to use it for starting my future business. There was a letter inside the box you gave me. It explained everything and also said this, I'd love to stay longer, but I must be on my way. If you want to see me, come to the Verark Basin of Ezerock. I'm sure he used the Bat Metamorphosis Potion and turned into a bat to fly there. Please go to the Verark Basin where the Orcs live, kill the Giant Runebat and retrieve my Gold Dust Pouch.	There's a time limit on the Bat Potion, so you need to defeat him before the time is up. Go to the Verark Basin where the Orcs live, kill the Giant Runebat and retrieve the Gold Dust Pouch.	Oh, my Gold Dust. I almost lost it to a good-looking villain. From now on, I'll be wary of all so-called 'heroes.'

According to his letter, it's from your master. He asked to have everything in that box safely looked after. You can't open the lock? Hmm, you're right. You could take it to Blacksmith Bulcan west of the central plaza. He'll help you out.	Having been a magic armor merchant for so long, I can see the lock on this box isn't an ordinary lock. Go to Blacksmith Bulkan west of the central plaza and show him this box. He'll help you out.	No, no. This isn't a job for a blacksmith, but it might be fun getting that lock open...

Oh, in order to break this lock, I need a flame made by burning Torge Leaves.  But not even an axe can cut Torge Branches, so what you need to do is go near Nocturn Yard and destroy twenty Rock Torges. Meanwhile, I can get the Branches from them.	We should help each other as long as we need to. Go near Nocturn Yard and destroy twenty Rock Torges. Otherwise, I won't be able to open the lock.	Good job. I take it that wasn't too difficult.

No, I won't request the help of a sorcerer. They'll laugh at me and say my magic is a joke, but we both know that's not true. Fortunately, I have a secret stash of Seal Lifting Potion's just in case. However, you have to go get it for me. Bring me the Seal Lifting Potion from underneath a rock in the Shadow Graves.	This is what they call a vision.  Bring me the Seal Lifting Potion from underneath a rock in the Shadow Grave.	Hmm, Good job. Fortunately, it's well sealed and hasn't dried up yet. Good.

I think they're after something, but I can't figure out what. Fortunately, Sorcerer Ron of Tullan found a solution. His message said, 'Being the owner, you should try your hardest,' which I don't understand, but it also said he would help me if I brought him ten Spider's Legs. I couldn't figure out how I could get Spiders' Legs when I couldn't even leave the village, but now I see fate sent you here for a reason. Please help out a poor soul. Kill Arachnoid Drones and get ten Spider's Legs using your Meat Carving skill. Then take them to Sorcerer Ron west of Tullan.	Oh, he could get the things he needs by himself, but I can see he wants me to do it for him. Anyway, slay the Arachnoid Drones, and get 10 Spider's Legs by using your Meat Carving skill on them, then go to Sorcerer Ron west of the city.	Spider's Legs. Why did you bring these to me? Oh, it concerns Beacon Village. Well, I told Roten that as an owner, he must make an effort to get what he wants. That's why I told him to bring these himself.  But you bringing these gives no meaning to what I said.  It's not like I don't know Roten, but...  You worked too hard for me to not help you.

Not long ago, Bolham Bacon, the eldest of the Bacon boys, stole their treasure during his travels. But he knew there would be trouble if he kept the treasure inside the village, so he put in his will that the treasure should be buried with him. Of course, the Vampire Wills attacked the village because they're unaware of the will. So, first we must find the treasure. Bolham's grave is quite far away from the village. Find the Vampire's Treasure Chest under the tombstone west of the Old Port Area and bring it back here.	Bolham Bacon coveted something he couldn't even use and now his descendants are paying for it. Let's make things better around here.  Find the Vampires' Treasure Chest under the tombstone west of the Old Harbor and bring it back.	You returned safely with the chest.

But you can with magic. After speaking with them about the box, I decided to put it where they want it to be. The plains to the south of Beacon Village. But it's a dangerous area because of the Silver Moths, so you must help me. Go south of Shump Village, kill fifteen Giant Silver Moths there to keep me safe. Then go to Citizen Roten of Beacon Village and tell him everything has been taken care of.	This will be difficult for both of us, so let's get it over with. Go south of Shump Village and destroy fifteen Giant Silver Moths to help keep me safe. Then go to Citizen Roten of Beacon Village and reassure him.	Oh, hello. What happened? He should've told me about the treasure earlier instead of taking it to his grave with him. Are you saying I should be satisfied with being left in peace again? Oh, I don't mean any harm.

284	The Rule of Nature	Rage of the Giant Silver Moths	Tullan; Cutty	1		33				1			<Mayor> Cutty	<Adventurer> Lariat				A century ago, Castle Tullan was crushed by Ugdrasil's army in the Hundred Days War. After the war was over, Monk Zian Manas ordered that a moat be dug around the castle for defense purposes. That is how this moat was created. Water is delivered through a waterway from the Blue River in the east, but recently, a Silver Moth named Ding has been fiercely attacking soldiers near the bridge, which crosses this waterway. There were such diverse opinions on this matter that we put Rope in charge of the investigation. We need to give him three bottles of Large Life Potion, but I have none with me. Find some potion and give them to Adventurer Rope east of the city.	He's still investigating. He needs plenty of Life Potions or Mana Potions because he always runs into monsters when he goes out.  Deliver three bottles of Large Life Potion to Adventurer Rope east of the city.	It's a Life Potion. This task is harder than you might think. When you come into contact with Ding, just a few Life Potions won't be enough. She's very poisonous. Do you want to learn more about this task? I've done some research. Give me a second. Even I need a rest now and then!			233	Large Life Potion	3																																			1. Get three bottles of Large Life Potion.	11	2.

Not long ago, it seems her eggs all washed away in a flood and ended up in the moat of Tullan. Since then, Ding has been looking for them and ended up getting into fights with the soldiers patrolling the city. I tried looking for them myself, but didn't have any luck. So go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and ask him if he's seen the eggs.	Well, monster eggs are still eggs, I suppose. Ding is exceptional in that we can communicate with her. So go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and ask him if he's seen the eggs.	Oh, e-eggs?  Of course, I've seen them.  Oh, I don't know if I should tell the truth...  But I will.

It'd be possible for Ding? Had I known, I would have stopped the soldiers from eating the eggs. S-so what are we going to do? Well, yes. They didn't eat all the eggs. A few still remain. But the Vampire Wills probably took them. Who knows? They're probably going to eat them, too. We should at least find those eggs, right? I think I can help. Slay ten Vampire Wills near Beacon Village for me. I'll try to find the eggs on their bodies.	We have no other choice. Slay ten Vampire Wills near Beacon Village for me. I'll try to find the eggs.

The soldiers are pretty good at it as long as they have the right equipment. Get fifteen Tough Cobwebs. Use your Ransacking skill on Arachnoid Drones and you should be able to get them.

What's important is that I hid it deep where they wouldn't be able to find it. I hope my friend will find it for me, but if he can't, it will be your duty, my beloved student. Go to the place mentioned in this letter and bring back what was hidden by your master. Retrieve the Turquoise Jewel from the guard post, which stands south outside Tullan Castle.	I pass through that place everyday, so it's surprising to hear there's something hidden there, but I guess since your master said it, it must be true.

You see, when the Undead started to appear in the land called the Vengeful Basin, I used a Ghost-Repelling Talisman to suppress their energy. That's why the Skeletons haven't been leaving the Vengeful Basin. This Dagger of Fear also contains the vengeful spirits of the dead. It looks like the talisman is the only way to get rid of them.

It's a safe place, difficult to reach and unlikely to have any treasure whatsoever.  But I think Red Ribbon found out about our plan. So leaving the gem there is as good as inviting him to take it.

In the King's Hunting Field, there's a tent His Majesty's ancestors used now and again. He didn't use it much, but kept it in place to help maintain the Grounds. Well, prior to carrying out our plan, we ordered our men to go there and bring back anything valuable so that we could keep it safe. Unfortunately, they were attacked by monsters and lost two items. Go find the Young Dreadwolves outside the east gate of Tullan and bring back the Old Operational Map, that's one of the two items.	Young Dreadwolves are ferocious beasts. We never know when they'll tear up the things they've taken, so please hurry. Go to the Young Dreadwolves outside the east gate of Dulan and bring back the Old Operational Map from them.

Perhaps that record may be the only thing, besides His Majesty's memory, that will prove to be a record of our history. Your task it to find this record. Go west of the King's Hunting Field, defeat the Shadow Bears and retrieve the Old Hunting Record.	We all have things we value. Sometimes it's valued universally by everyone. Sometimes it can be relative, meaning it only holds value for us. His Majesty's Old Hunting Record is the latter. So stop messing around. Go west of the King's Hunting Grounds, defeat the Shadow Bears and retrieve the Old Hunting Record.	Good job. This finalizes the main preparations.

334	Dangerous Book	Far Away Dispatch	Tullan; Beacon	1		37				1			<General> Beacon	<Elder> Mybling				We have a problem. One of the valuables from inside the palace has been stolen. It's called the 'Book of Havoc.'  It's a one-of-a-kind book that lists all the powerful magic that has been secretly researched in the palace. Last night, the Spriggans stole it. We responded swiftly and searched the headquarters of the Spriggans, but haven't found it yet.  After questioning the Spriggans, we found out that one of them went to Ellore with the book. He plans to go to the east using a portal. Entering the land of the Orcs is a very delicate matter, so we're carefully preparing a plan.  You're not one of us, but please go find the Book of Havoc. First go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already talked to him.	We'd almost finished creating our plan and were debating who to send.  That's when you showed up. Go to Elder Mybling at the western entrance of Ellore. I've already spoken him.	General Beacon told me someone was coming to see me. You don't look old enough to join our village, but I guess you can hold your own. Your face glows and your eyes are full of life. I'm sure you'll be able to complete this task.

That's why you have to go first to Ezerock through Silancium in the eastern area. When you arrive, be careful not to wander around too much and don't cause trouble. From there, go to Trilgard, the city of Orcs, and find Mayor Prosto, at the east end of the city. Tell him the situation. It would be rude to go empty-handed, so let me tell you what to get. You'll see a tree when you go south of the King's Hunting Field. That tree covers the Earth's Eye. Find it and bring it to the Mayor of Trilgard to get his help.	Security Chief Koop, who rules over Zylok, isn't someone you can reason with. Go to Trilgard in Ezerock and find Mayor Prosto east of the city. Don't forget to take the Earth's Eye, which can be found in the roots of a tree south of the King's Hunting Field. Prosto will help you.	The Earth's Eye represents your affection for us. What brings you all the way to Trilgard? Are you here to deliver good news or bad news?  Hmm, so that's what happened.

My soldiers are great fighters, but seem reluctant to help strangers.  I apologize. Still, believe in their searching abilities and go south of the Village of Rest. Destroy Spriggan Combatants there.

Then find the Book of Havoc and return to the city of Tullan. General Beacon will be waiting for you north of Tullan Castle.	I'd like to ask you to stay longer and get some rest, but there are still many who don't like strangers within the castle. I just think it's best if you leave as soon as possible. Don't take it personally! Go to the Pandaram Plateau west of the Village of Rest and defeat the Rune Werewolves. Then find the Book of Havoc and give it to General Beacon north of Tullan Castle.

I destroyed too many Forest Buckets in the King's Hunting Field because I figured its tendon would be a good string for a bow. Well, I think the Earth Elemental is now furious. I received the revelation that I'll have pain in my two legs as long as I stand on this earth. According to my tribesmen, only parsley juice will alleviate the pain. Please buy fifteen bunches of Parsley from a cook for me. It should help me quite a bit.	Unless you've experienced it, you can't imagine the pain you have to endure when you make the Elementals mad.

She returned not long ago. So go to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city and ask her the solution.	We cherish the Water Elemental, so making the Earth Elemental angry is always a possibility. That's why, for generations, we've learned various ways of appeasing the Earth Elemental. Go to Archer Armor Merchant Noviel southeast of the city and ask her for the solution.	Actually, I was the one who urged her to hunt the Forest Bucks, so I should be punished as well. It hurts me to see Ermelen take it all on herself, but I found a solution this time so we won't have to worry anymore.																																								1.

In this case, we angered the Earth Elemental, so I'm sure we'll be able to find the Crystal of Earth Fury near the King's Hunting Field.

It's easier to hunt when the target loses his sense of calm preparation, so now we're at an advantage. However, one thing worries me. We don't have enough items to lure him in. He likes the eyes of Beholders. But we have none right now because they go bad easily and are hard to store. I'd like to request your services. Please go to the Warrior Plain and destroy Death Watchers. Use your Ransacking skill on them to get ten Beholder's Eyes.	It's easy to lure a drugged target into a trap because he's not being rational, but Spriggans are quite fast so we have to finish everything before he calms down. Hurry. Go to the Warrior Plain and destroy Death Eyeballs. Then use your Ransacking skill on them to get ten Beholder's Eyes.	Good. We can carry out our plan with this.

I hear he's over 120 years old and even fought in Zian and Ugdrasil's Hundred Days War. Anyway, he's respected as the city's elder for many reasons. The city puts on a big play once every year. He takes the role of the hero that saves the city and everyone else supports him. Strangers may find it a little funny, but it's very touching to the people of Tullan, who've constantly been involved in war. We need quite a few people for this play. Why don't you join us? Go to Guard Arian in front of the south gate of the city and he'll tell you your role.	The play is for one person, but it still requires a lot of work in order to maintain its fun.

So we try to help him as much as we can. We even have food for him in advance. He'll be coming to the front of the castle soon, so we must prepare the food.

We've decided to attack the carriage transferring him, but we don't know which road it's going to take. They're sending out several carriages on different roads so no one knows where the real Red Ribbon is. The only person who can get useful information is requesting a big reward in return for it.  I'd handle this if it wasn't much, but it's out of my league. If it's okay, I'd like you to take care of it. I think five hundred Gold would help a lot.	I know it's a lot of money, but it's urgent.

But the Jewel of Observation we planted on him hasn't been found yet. I think it would help us reveal this conspiracy. So I was wondering if you could help me.

The nobleman he killed managed all intelligence gathering for Tullan Castle, which means sensitive secrets may end up in the hands of those who wish us harm - including Orcs. No matter what anyone says, they were once our enemy and we must always be cautious. We'll have to handle this very prudently, not using our usual diplomatic approach, but some other way. There's a sorcerer named Mormorine in Trilgard. Go tell him our situation. Oh, don't go empty-handed. Destroy fifteen Black Werewolves in Baran Dyke Fortress and take them to him. It's a sure way to gain their respect.	What are you still doing here? It's good to be cautious, but come on. Go to Barandike Foretress and destroy fifteen Black Werewolves. Then take them to Sorcerer Mormorine in Trilgard and tell him about our situation.	The great General Beacon sent you. Excellent.

Destroy the Vampire Agony at the Elloham Watchtower and bring back the Book of Death. It's the only way.	The people of Tullan own this land, not the Vampires. We have to teach them a lesson. Take down the Vampire Agony in the Elloham Watchtower and bring back the Book of Death.	So, this is the Book of Death. Just touching it stings my fingers. Good job. What will I do with it?

Of course, I'm sure Spriggans took it. His Majesty's using this opportunity to come up with a plan to occupy Redderhood. So we would like you to help.

Of course he'll use magic to get right back up again. What a waste of time. I guess Redderhood will have to be under his control for a while.

This will make soldiers approaching redderhood feel heavy and eventually lock up their whole body. I ask you to steal the Talisman. A man of your skills should be able to do it.

It's time to attack Redderhood and give it back its freedom. The Hunters, the original owners of Redderhood, should help us. They'll hunt the monsters nearby and get Production Items, attracting attention and creating a diversion. Meanwhile, the partisans can strike and do their job. I understand you want to join the defenders, but they're composed of only the best Tullan soldiers, so you go with the Hunters and destroy Forest Deer and bring back ten pieces of Deer Grass. Use your Ransacking Skill to collect them.	You must work hard to deceive your opponent. Loaf around like you're doing now and the Spriggans will find out right away! So go destroy the Forest Bucks and use your Ransacking Skill to bring back ten pieces of Deer Grass from them.	You've done very well.  Now, the partisans will finish up the job.

If we send in our troops, they'll surely kill the soldiers.  We need to move with caution, which is why I must request your services again. Go to Redderhood and kill the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.  That will make his men disperse and help our defenders escape. Help us!	The Spriggans aren't very patient but they are violent. If we don't do something, the partisans will all die. Not only is each and every one of them important, but I also don't want to lose the main force of Dulan.  So go to Redderhood and take down the Spriggan Lord Bouldo.	All of Tullan is indebted to you!

Then when it didn't turn out the way they expected, they trashed the place. In order to remove the tattoos, I need to bring water from outside the castle, but they won't let me leave. Could you bring me some Clear Purified Water from between the Relics near the Seraphim Watchtower? Remember, only that water will work.	You're still here? You want to know more about the well? Hmm. It was created by my ancestors who once lived near the Elloham Watchtower. Ever since the day it was created, it's had the power to wash off anything, which is why I need it.

It's about my little brother. I hear he's made a lot of money recently and will be richer than I am soon. Do you think a billionaire like me will allow that? That's why I need your help. Of all his boxes in the center of the city, steal the Treasure Chest.  That'll do some big damage to his wealth. Hahaha. No, it's not stealing.  I'm simply trying to balance out the finances of this city. Hmm.	You must be hesitating because you think it's stealing. Well, you mustn't sacrifice the big for the small.

I'm a little upset about my younger brother being richer than me, but I don't want him to be tortured to death. Still, I can't return this, either.  So I've come up with an idea. We'll make it look like the Hobgoblins stole it. How? Simple! I'll take the box out to their area and then bring it back as if I found it. Sounds good, huh? Go west of Low Wind Village and destroy twenty Hobgoblins so I can make this work. I'll be counting on you!	What are you doing? Do you think my ancestors will leave you alone if I'm beaten to death by the Hobgoblins? Why am I pretending like this? Well, my younger brother has soldiers scattered all over looking for his Treasure Chest. In order to trick them, I need something powerful. A play that has life on the line. Okay? So go west of the Low Wind Village and destroy twenty Hobgoblins for me.	Oh, we almost got in big trouble! Wait. Let me catch my breath. What happened? I lost the Treasure Chest!

I can't and will not lose them! They're my entire fortune! But I can't solve his problem, either, because it's too difficult. I will have to end up using the ace up my sleeve.

There's a port in Delafaras, so taking a big boat should be much more convenient. The merchants of Delfaras seem to have been thinking the same. I heard they were hiring civil engineers from all over for a big project and sent my son as well. He's also a talented civil engineer, but it's been three months since he left and I haven't heard from him. Don't you find it weird? I'd like to ask my friend Pazarappi, but he's just so busy. So I was wondering if you could deliver a Hammer of the Elementals to Blacksmith Pazarappi, west of Delfaras Square, for me. It symbolizes the trust among us blacksmiths.	You're taking too much time just because he's not your son. I don't like that kind of attitude. Stop standing around and go west of Delfaras Square.

He's a merchant, so I'm sure he'll release Dolce if you give him something valuable, and I know something he wants. There's a tomb of the ancients southwest of Tullan. There's a Broken Coffin there with an Ancient Perfume inside. I hear the perfume gives off a scent incomparable to anything in the world. I'm sure Goldilocks will like it.  Take the Perfume to Caravan Goldilocks southwest of the city.	Goldbeard is brutal to those who steal his things. Sometimes he privately executes them or sells them as slaves to foreign ships. Of course, I trust Dolce didn't steal anything, but this is our only choice since we can't prove his innocence. Find the Ancient Perfume from the Broken Coffin southwest of Tullan and deliver it to Blacksmith Goldbeard southwest of the city.	Oh, this smells amazing! It's definitely the Ancient Perfume! Where did you find it? What? You're giving it to me? But I'm a merchant, I know nothing in this world is free. Tell me what you want in return. Hmm, so you think Dolce is innocent and he should be released. I'll think about it. As a merchant, I always have to consider if something's profitable.																				139331520	2571	Ancient Perfume	1																	1.

I hear a small group of Young Gorgons live south of Tullan. Have you ever seen them? I hear they're the ones who took my Valuables Box. Go to Elloham Watchtower, destroy the Young Gorgons and retrieve my Valuables Box. That will prove Dolce's innocence.	I can't wait forever. This gift is the only reason I'm considering it. So go to Elloham Watchtower, destroy the Young Gorgons and retrieve the Valuables Box.	This is definitely mine. I guess Dolce didn't take it after all. Hmm.

Your task will be to go over near the Dry River Plains of Silancium, the land of Orcs, and kill ten Arkaros Slaves. Let's go!	Hey, if you return this soon, I can't stay there for long.

Anyway, Usus had been watching us carefully for an opening to attack Tullan Castle and rumor has it the weapons he hid for this attack are still scattered around this area. I'm telling you this because of a problem we currently have. Young Gorgons of Silancium have shown up around here looking for those weapons Usus hid and are clashing with the weapons merchants in the village, creating a lot of trouble. I'd like you to help us. Your job is simple. Destroy twenty-five Young Gorgons south of the Elloham Watchtower and show them not to mess with us.	Members of the merchants' guilds have been complaining about this incident, but you're just being lazy. Go south of the Elloham Watchtower and destroy twenty-five Young Gorgons, unless you want us to teach you a lesson.	Good job.

If it's okay, I'd like you to get us some. Bring us ten slabs of Meat from a cook.	We'll take care of the cooking somehow. Get ten slabs of Meat from a cook.

Grimlot, who was Usus's lieutenant at the time, was driven out by the soldiers and fled to Low Wind Village. Well, he didn't want to have his weapon taken by Humans, so he hid it under a rock. Doesn't that sound interesting? You could try looking for it. Find Grimlot's Mace under one of the rocks in Low Wind Village and bring it back here.	Well, it's not a legendary weapon and Orc weapons are of no use to us. But we can sell it to Orcs at a high price, so that's good. Hurry up and go to Low Wind Village to find the Grimlot's Mace under one of the rocks.	You found it easily?  Well, no one else could've done that.  We merchants certainly couldn't find it.

She might change her mind if we get a chance to show our skills again for His Majesty.

Find the Cursed Broken Armor and go to Warrior Trainer Eron southwest of the city and try to find a solution. Then she'll think of returning to the palace as well.	That's cursed armor. It seems like it's hidden somewhere irrelevant, but it's there to afflict His Majesty. We must find it as soon as possible. Go to the old building northeast of the Broken Bridge and find the Broken Armor. Then take it to Warrior Trainer Aaron southwest of the city.	Hmm, what's this armor? It gives off some very strong, disturbing energy.  Hmm, is that what happened? I remember when I left the palace five years ago.

There are ruins of the sorcerer Rakane's house near the gateway, northwest of Low Wind Village. Long ago he lived there alone, researching some evil sorcery. Then Nathan Manas killed him. But before he died, he hid a Wand that would open this area. No one goes near the ruins because of the negative energy around the area.

She may be loud and annoying, but I step up and take care of her mess. She is, after all, my wife. You want to help? I appreciate it, but this job is only for an adventurer.

Surely two is better than one, especially when we're going to Death Plane. What? Oh, I don't go to places like Dulan or nearby Shinewood. I go to far off places like Syllancium. I need to find Dark Wyverns from the Dusty Creek. Then what? Well, then I offer their hearts as a sacrifice for the Sealed Sword. What for? Well, to make the sword work again. See, it lost its power when it was pulled from the standing stones, so I have to revive it before I return it. I shouldn't have to explain this. Anyway, first I need to bring down Dark Wyverns, but I honestly don't think I can do it alone. Help me destroy fifteen Dark Wyverns. Let's go.	Now, don't do that. Since we've agreed to go together, I have no choice if you keep idling around like that. I'll get in trouble with my wife. Go to Dusty Creek of Silancium and destroy fifteen Dark Wyverns with me.	Did you completely get rid of them? I don't know if I can trust you since you don't have any wounds, but tasks like these are all about trust. It would've been better for me to accompany you. Hmm. Maybe I should just trust you. I admit, I'm even a little too suspicious to even thank you.						630	Dark Wyvern	15																																1.

Thanks to the list, we were able to find most of them and get them to confess, but the one suspected to be the key figure says he has nothing to do with any of it. We have to be careful. He's a man of high status in the city. His servant says he has something to tell us about his master and is requesting some compensation. I think we have to give him what he wants, and I need your help. Bring me ten Goblins' Heads. You can get them from the Hobgoblins west of Low Wind Village using your Ransacking skill.

The reason I'm so passionate about this right now is because of one recent traveler who ate and slept at my inn and then ran away without paying. I quickly chased him and was able to find out which direction he fled. I've released my hunting dogs and am pursuing him, but there's a problem. The hunting dogs may be brave enough to pass by the monsters, but I'm not. So help me and get rid of them. Go south of the Elloham Watchtower and destroy twenty-five Centaur Cavalrymen.	The hunting dogs are fast, so they may have caught up with him already, but if we don't follow along they might give up their chase.

Hmm, I feel bad for the innkeeper, but what can we do? Oh, one thing. The traveler had a necklace that looked quite expensive. I guess it's now inside one of the Dreadwolves. We should destroy them, get the Traveler's Necklace and take it to Innkeeper Badwell, northeast of the city. It should at least pay for everything the traveler ate.	I heard a Dreadwolf's stomach acid is so strong it can even dissolve a stone. So the necklace in their stomach won't be staying around for long.

Then, let me tell you what you should do. The Mobet Largewings can fly, and since I'm short, I can't attack them unless I bring them down to the ground.

I think they're trying to ruin the ceremony and blame each other.  Nothing will get done at this rate, but we don't have time to correct it now, so I was thinking...  Let's catch them off guard by taking a different road. We're going to go back south of the Dusty Creek and need you to open a path for us by destroying ten Fountain Lamias. Return here when you're finished, please.	You haven't left, yet. I know it's dangerous, but don't you know it'll only get worse if you don't get going? It could mean your downfall, so hurry. Go south of the Dusty Creek and destroy ten Fountain Lamias.	It was dangerous, but you succeeded and we got what we wanted. But this is quite sad. How did it end up like this? Maybe it's because of everyone pursuing the Archons. The Archlord could be someone who brings confusion. Anyway, I'm deeply grateful for all the help. It's not easy helping out another tribe.

It can only be cured with magic, but I haven't found exactly how yet. After researching almost to death, I've found a way I can extend my life. It may be a temporary solution, but it's a blessing for someone who needs as many years as he can get. Of course, it doesn't matter how mentally strong you are if you're physically weak. I'm in such pain right now I can't even take a step, so I need your help. There's something called an Ancient Glass Bottle inside the trunk of a tree in Salarmis Garden. I discovered it a long time ago, but hid it there because it's so valuable. I need it now, so please find it and bring it to me.	It's funny that I forgot about it when I need it so urgently, isn't it? I agree, but what can I say? I don't know everything. Anyway, find the Ancient Glass Bottle inside the trunk of a tree in Salarmis's Garden and bring it back.	You brought it! Good job. Just looking at it makes me feel stronger, but I can't move yet, so I'll still need your help. Don't worry too much.

Please take this Ancient Glass Bottle southeast of Shump Village and destroy twenty Frost Thieves. It will collect energy from them that's as cold as ice. Then bring it back to me. Don't forget, it'll be no use hunting down the Frost Thieves if you drop the bottle along the way.	Be careful. If it breaks, everything will go up in smoke and I could die tomorrow. Take the Ancient Glass Bottle southeast of Shump Village and destroy twenty Frost Thieves.	Ugh, the cold energy from the bottle has practically frozen my entire body, but I feel a lot calmer.

It can't be tainted by too much civilization, so I can't get it from Membreden or Limelight. It must be pure underground water. There's only one place I know to find it. The village well in Village of Seethe in Syllancium. Please bring me some water from that well.	Seeing you hesitate is making me nervous. Don't try to trick me by bringing me just any kind of water. Only Pure Underground Water from the well in the Village of Seethe of Silancium is acceptable.	Let's see if you brought me the right water.  Hey, I feel refreshed! That's better. Thanks to you, I've come alive again, at least temporarily.  Now it's time for me to prepare myself to seek revenge on those who made me like this! Good job.

I've collected thousands of crafts while traveling around the world. Well, my wife found the Gold crafts I'd been hiding from her and took them from me, but I can't just sit back and take this. I'll just have to start over again. I heard a craftsman in Delfaras has some really nice Gold decor. I also heard you can get her attention if you bring her the Hammer of Handicraft. You'll need to hunt down Young Harpies in Shinewood to get this hammer. Then take it to Craftsman Givinia southwest of Delfaras.	I hear the Hammer of Handicraft used to be her master's, but was stolen by the Young Harpies. Go to Shinewood, destroy the Young Harpies and find the Hammer of Handicraft. Then take it to Craftsman Givinia southwest of Delfaras.	Oh, this is the Hammer of Handicraft! Where did you find this? Hmm, I see. Well, I've been feeling guilty every day since I lost my master's hammer. I'll grant you your request if you give it back to me.

I don't have it, but neither does anyone else. I need to ask around for details. Do me a favor while I make inquiries. Get me a Double Bow. Someone asked me to customize one.  Please.	What are you doing? You don't seem to be very loyal! If you think I'm unfair, then get me one Double Bow.	Oh, thank you. Now I just need to get it crated.

Then deliver it to Adventurer Rope east of Tullan.	You know, it's no use looking at me like a lost puppy.

I'm not too happy about it, since it sounds like they're trying to control our city, but His Majesty's subjects have complied. I heard the Stone and Sword Society Headquarters is on the 'Mountain of Endless Snow,' but it can't be reached by land. So the sorcerers suggest it be reached by water. The small lake north of Low Wind Village should act as the path. It's time to use that path and I guess I should tell the Low Wind Village Chief beforehand. Go to Village Chief Ariti Stillwisperer of Low Wind Village and ask for his help. Take three Bone Shields with you and he'll understand.	He and I are loyal friends, so I think a practical gift would be more effective than something big and lavish. Deliver three Bone Shields to Village Chief Aliti Stillwhisperer of Low Wind Village.	If it's Mayor Cutty's request, I'll have to comply. It's hard to find a citizen of Tullan with such a deep understanding of this village. So there's no need for a gift, but I'll accept it since we'll be able to use it to protect the village. Thank you.			269	Bone Shield	3																																			1.

What about this? Take down the Frost Thieves near the southern gateway of Tullan and get ten Thieves' Daggers using your Ransacking skill.  Then bring them to Mayor Cutty south of the central plaza. This should confuse them about why you're here.	Going back and forth like that will make them suspect you!

That's why it becomes very inconvenient for travelers when the path gets blocked. I hear there have been numerous incidents where Harpies have attacked travelers. It cannot be allowed, but we also cannot wield any sort of weapon on any life form living in our woods. That's the basic rule of Ellore.  So I must ask a favor of you. Destroy ten Harpies near the Woodcutters' Forest and bring them back here.	Harpies can fly, so they're the least affected by the forest. They're swift and snatch things in the blink of an eye. Destroy ten Harpies near Woodcutter Pass and bring them back.	Oh, good job. I often ask travelers to destroy them for me, but no one has done it as well as you have. Good job, but don't go yet.

He asked the villagers to search the forest and they found out it was taken by Bolko, who lives in the Dead Torges Forest. Torges who disrupt their society are exiled there, hence the name but a Rain Torge named Bolko, who was exiled there a few years ago, managed to gather other Torges into a kingdom of his own. Apparently he started using the Symbol of Darkness as his source of power. Those living in the forest must help others maintain order. According to the merchant, Bolko put the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbors Forest. I'd like you to retrieve the Symbol of Darkness, please.	I know it's a difficult task, but it's worth it to keep order in the forest.  Be careful. Find the Symbol of Darkness under the torchlight in the Dead Arbors Forest.	Just looking at it makes me flinch. I think the Elementals will be angry if we leave it in this forest any longer, but it does belong to the traveler, so we'll have to keep it until he comes for it. Oh, I forgot to thank you.  But it's not over yet. Bolko's still alive.

Hmm, you believe the story? Yes, you believe it? Well, your eyes certainly suggest you're not lying. Let me get to the point anyway. The guilds that I highly respect say one of their members is missing. We often go searching for missing people, but the problem is that this time, it's the grandson of a Tullan nobleman. They're telling me to find traces of his disappearance somehow or other. So just pretend you're doing a good deed and help me out. Go outside to the tree southwest of the village and look for anything he might have had at the time he disappeared. For example, a bow. He was an archer, you know.	They say no one needs to be scared in Ellore, but I often go to the big city on business. So please go to the tree southwest outside the village and look for something like a bow.	Oh, you found it.

Plus, they even want to lead the search themselves. What power do we have? Well, I'm going to search with my men, but we have no weapons. You know why our people don't carry weapons, right?  It's the law of this village. So you must find us some weapons. What would be good? That's it! Even a fool can shoot a crossbow, so let's make it that. Find us five Wood Crossbows.	I'm not saying noblemen are fools, but I think it's better for them to use crossbows rather than carelessly wield swords. So find five Wood Crossbows for me.	Good job.

What I'm saying is I'd like you to take down the monster that the noblemen are scared of.  Go to Salarmis Garden and destroy fifteen Centaur Scouts. I know. The grandson hadn't gone to Salarmis Garden. Maybe, as a nobleman, he just wanted to look at the area he's never seen before. Please go there.	What are you doing? I'll be in a lot of trouble if a nobleman gets hurt. Aren't you afraid of that? What? It doesn't concern you? Gosh! Well, you offered to help, so don't waste time.

I guess it's been handed down generation after geneartion. Where is it? Well, I didn't just lay here wasting time. I pressed the guild members and got some information. Apparently he died because of the Rain Torges. Rain Torges kill those who invade the forest. They never eat them, but they do tend to collect war trophies. What I'm saying is chances are good they have what the nobleman is looking for, got it? So go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	What? Are you hesitating because you don't trust me? Go on. Go northwest out of Ellore, destroy the Rain Torges and bring back the Gleaming Ring.	Is this what the nobleman wanted us to find?

Longo didn't fall for the trap, and worse, my men hiding out around the trap were injured. At this rate, the village will be in ruins. I can't put Ellore in danger because of my mistakes. I admit I don't want to be blamed for this. Does it sound crazy to ask you to help? No? Then hear me out. We have to be more straightforward. What I mean is...  I need you to go to the Prince's Hunting Field and defeat the Centaur Airborne Longo.	Ellore is protected by the Elmentals, so there's no problem even if Longo tried to harm us. But it pays to be prepared. You never know what will happen down the road. So go to the Prince's Hunting Field and defeat the Winged Centaur Longo.	What a relief. No, I wasn't worried about my abilities. I was just worried about my relationship with the village. Anyway, we successfully completed the task with your help.

Oh, I was saying my goal in life has been to cultivate a great pupil. (mumbles) But I'm discouraged by all the fools out there.  For example, a friend sent me two pupils who were supposed to be quite bright, but they couldn't even pass the simplest of tests.  (mumbles) Still, they were sent by my friend, so I can't just let them die out there. I'm so busy right now, though, I need to ask you to help. Go South of Dragon's Inn and destroy ten Thunder Griffins. That will help one of the pupils escape. No more than ten.  That's just the right number for his skills.	Hey, do you want to see him die? And see my friend in despair?  Hurry south of the Dragon's Lair and destroy ten Thunder Griffins.	He's covered in blood, but managed to return. He must be worse than I thought. Maybe he would have returned unhurt if you had destroyed fifteen Thunder Griffins. Anyway, he's disqualified. Hrmph. Don't go yet.  I told you there were two pupils.						710	Thunder Griffin	10																																1. Destroy ten Thunder Griffins south of the Dragon's Inn.	4	2.

I have no idea where the other one is. There's always that one who won't follow instructions and wanders off. I need to find him. Oh, I told you why before. They're free to die if they want, but they are my friend's pupils after all, and I think my friend expects to get them back. I gave the boy the Document of Time and asked him to go against time. I guess I was asking too much. He's probably lost in the wrong section of time now. He went east of the village so he must be in the Prince's Hunting Field where there's a Monument of Ancient Civilization. It's relatively easy to go back in time if you pass through something like that. He probably did, so I'm sure we'll be able to find the Document of Time there. Bring it back to me! I need it to find out where he is.	Hey, If he'd taken the Document of Time, he probably wouldn't have gotten lost. I'm sure only his body traveled in time. Hmmph. Get the Document of Time from the Tombstone of Ancient Civilization in the Prince's Hunting Field.	Just as I expected. Hrmph. Wait, I need to track this document from the end. That fool.

But I don't think I can go alone. I have to make a Mirror of Alchemy and an alchemist is more fit for that job than I am.  So I asked Romiteus' help and he said he needs certain ingredients. I was wondering if you could get them for me.  Hrmph. How could you ask such an old man like me to do it?  If I were as young as you, it would be a piece of cake. Go near Lizardman's Claw in Membreathen and you'll find lots of Lizardmen Scouts. Use your Skinning skills on them and get fifteen Lizardmen's Skins. Then take them to Alchemist Romiteus southeast of the village.	Hey, what are you doing here? I already explained everything. Go near Lizardman's Claw in Membreathen and you'll find lots of Lizardman Scouts. Use your Skinning skills on them and get fifteen Lizardmen Skins. Then take them to Alchemist Romiteus southeast of the village.	You came when I was feeling very hungry. Do you have anything to eat? I can't eat Lizardmen's skin. I want meat. Oh, right.

I'm too hungry now to explain what it is. Just do something for me while I finish eating. There's one more thing I need to make the Mirror of Alchemy. It's called a Timesand Pouch and you can only get it from Wild Mobets south of Grand Crimson in Sillancium. Don't ask why. We don't have time to waste. Just bring it to me.	Are you still wondering about that? Well, as I understand it, there was once an ancient civilization in Syllancium. The king there was called 'Time King' because he could freely control time. I hear he also made the Climate Map north of Syllancium. Well, the most cherished item among his treasures was the Timesand. He wanted to keep it safe at all costs, so when the kingdom fell, he attached it to the foot of a Wild Mobet and let it fly away.	I've tried this twice so far. This is the second time. Now that I've eaten, I have more energy. Let's get to work. Thank you.			2561	Timesand Pouch	1	753	Wild Mobet		2561	Timesand Pouch	100	1																												1.

The mirror's almost complete, but there's one more thing you need to do for me. When he returns after traveling back in time, he will be completely worn out or unable to move. He won't be in his normal state. You can easily guess what will happen if he's attacked by monsters that way. It's horrible just thinking about it. So I think you should arrange the place where he's to return to in advance. Meanwhile, Mia and I will move him to a safe place. You need to act beforehand. You said he disappeared at the Prince's Hunting Grounds, right? That's where Centaur Airbornes show up. Destroy ten of them for me and I'll do my job before I go have a sandwich. Then you should return to Magic Trainer Mia, just South West of the village, and see how things are going.	What are you doing? I've given Mia the mirror and the magic to bring the pupil back has already started. Get moving. Go to the Prince's Hunting Field and destroy ten Centaur Airbornes. Then go to Magic Trainer Mia southwest of the village and you're done.	Those fools are troubling lots of people, huh? Hrmph. You offered to help out, so it's okay. But Romiteus and I have to help out as well?  An elderly person like me? Hrmph. Well, I'm glad they're safe. Those two have been deemed unsuitable and are to return to my friend. Thank you.

I used to patrol Ellore, but I fell in love with the beautiful scenery and people of Ellore and ended up settling down there. Still, it doesn't change the fact that I'm still from Tullan. I recently got an order from Tullan to steal an important item from this village. How can I betray them like that? But if I disobey an order, I might pay with my life. There are quite a few Tullan spies here disguised as travelers. So I think I'll have to try to trick them. You'll help me, won't you? I know you fell in love with Ellore and Shinewood as well. First, I need to pretend I'm working. I'll make noise like I'll be going out soon. Meanwhile, get three Maces for me. I need to at least pretend that I’m doing some digging.	What are you doing? You might be suspected as a conspirator, so don't mess up. Get me three Maces!	Good. They're good quality. Too bad I won't be using them. What a shame. Right. Well, thank you.

I guess I should work in the Woodcutter Pass since there are Windwing Harpies there. Destroy fifteen Windwing Harpies for me.	What are you doing? Do you want us to die? Go to the Woodcutter Pass and destroy fifteen Windwing Harpys!	That's it. We're a great team. Very good.  That's the way to do it.

Like I said, Tullan wants me to bring back a certain item. The treasure of Ellore! But they don't know what it is. Of course, I don't, either. Anyway, I need to give them something and I was trying to think of what would work. Then a great idea suddenly came to mind. There's a tree in the lower part of Salarmis Garden. I saw some kind of document between the branches. I don't know who hid it there, but I think it's been there for quite a long time. Bring me that document. The content? Who cares? Neither the people of Tullan nor we know what the real treasure of Ellore is. Got it?	What are you worried about? You want to know about the document? I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's not as important as Ellore's treasure. Come on, we're talking about something no one has any idea about, but your job is simple. Go to the lower part of Salarmis Garden and bring back the Document.	So? Doesn't this book look important? I'll just say it's the treasure.  Hmm. You're worried it might be full of scribbles?

But, something always happens on the day when this kind of contests takes place. I heard that my rival in Tullan has got a magnificent cooking utensil. If she uses that in the contest, then it'll be highly unlikely that I'll win! Well, I did have my chances. There was this time when a wandering merchant was selling the legendary cooking utensil in this village, but he was asking too much for it and I simply could not afford his price. Now I have more money, I think I will need to get that utensil. So I'd like to ask you a favor. Can you please go and find that wandering merchant and tell him to sell me that legendary cooking equipment? Who is he? Hehe.. I'm really glad you asked that question! You are definitely interested right? He's Peddler Keep Goathead who is from South Trilgard which is in the Orc lands. Take the 2 Water Necklaces that he wanted in exchange for the item. Ok?	There must be many others who would want such a fine cooking utensil. So Please hurry! Take 2 Water Necklaces to the Peddler Keep Goathead who is in Southern Trilgard.	Eh? What? Do you have anything to say to me? Ah... I remember. Yes I do remember. How can I forget that lady who was looking at me with such sad eyes? Yes, I do have the cooking utensil. But, I need more than 2 necklaces, the market conditions have changed. Also, I've just lost everything to a monster that I met in the desert, so I'm completely broke at the moment. So, I hope you understand my situation as well. So, what exactly is it that I want? Well.. there are too many things to list... let me think about it for a sec.			216	Water Necklace	2																																			1. Get 2 Water Necklaces.	11	2.

Anyway, I'll think about the cooking utensil if you avenge them for me. Yes? O.k. then. Can you hunt down 15 Vampire Magicians from Northern Poppyland. We can then talk about the utensil.	Ah, until you do me a favor, I am not going to talk about the cooking utensil. You have to kill 15 Vampire Magicians for me in Northern Poppyland, then we can talk!	No! I can't believe it! Without any evidence, I have no idea what you did! Oh, don't stare at me like that. I can't trade when there is a risk that I might make a loss. If you do this one thing for me, then I will definitely hand you over the cooking utensil. Marylith Countess took my money pouch and I need to get that back desperately. I don't need anything else.

Personally, I don't care what people do in the desert, but I have no choice since the village chief is all worried. So I ordered one of my men to bring back some evidence from the site of explosion. Unfortunately, he was eaten by a monster on his way back. Not only am I disturbed because I lost one of my men, but also because I lost the evidence.  You must bring it here to me.

I personally don't care about the politics, but I need to finish what I started. It seems the people of Elajins are developing a new weapon to attack Tullan. I think you should ask Gyslot to confirm that fact. He's from Elajins, so he probably has connections. Go to Traveler Gyslot, east of the village, and ask him about this incident.	It's a sensitive issue, so don't force him to talk. Go to Traveler Gyslot east of the village and ask him about the incident.	Hey, what's this? You suddenly show up and ask me questions? I'm from Ellanjeans, but I'm currently living in Ellore. So...  Hmm, I can't deny that I have information. This pendant belongs to my friend Beoul, the coyote. He's in charge of developing new weapons using gunpowder.  Recently, I heard he was killed during one of his experiments. It's top secret for fear Tullan would find out, but you're already aware of it.  Maybe the conflict betwen the two countries will keep going, which doesn't concern me. That's all.

That's why monsters both here and in Syllancium envy this place, but there are many layers of magic protecting the village and the secret that lies behind it. Not even the citizens of Ellore know the secret, but recently a traveler hiding in this village stole a document I had. It's the document that describes one of the many entrances into Ellore.

I, Lingdin, have lived in this village for five hundred years and I know promises are important. What I obtained is called Allas' Resonance Stone. Under certain conditions, it's said to resonate with sound when it's near an Archon, but I can't use it right now. I need the help of an engineer of Latria to make it work, but that place can't be reached at the moment. Anyway, that's what it is. This could be a powerful tool now that everyone's so crazy about finding the Archons, eh? That's why I've been hiding it, I feared it might cause trouble. Let me show you what I mean.

Anyway, we've heard a rumor that the door leading to the ruins below recently opened and monsters of all kinds came out. We normally don't concern ourselves with what happens in Silancium, but we have to this time since one of our people was hurt.  Fortunately, records of the ruins remain in the Village Of Seeth.

So I've decided to save the Guild Master first. Here's my plan. We'll go hunting and fake his death, pretending he's been killed by monsters. We can't bring any guild members along on this hunting trip, or they'll figure it out right away. So I considered going alone with him, but that might look suspicious. I have to ask you to join us. Are you sure you want to help us? What a loyal traveler you are. Let me tell you what part you'll play in the plan. It's pretty straightforward. Just hunt thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ivory Grave Village. That should be enough.	You'll help us a lot just by destroying thirty-five Lamia Ladies in Ivory Grave Village. Please!	Oh, that's hard.

Silancium and Windrill in the northern area are both incredibly barren. The magic storm that hit Windrill dried out Silancium as well. The blessings of the Elementals are the only thing that keep Shinewood so bountiful. That's why the people of Shinewood are always thankful and work hard to preserve the woods. They're also working to restore Silancium so it's always green. Strangers don't realize it, but every year a group makes sure Le Cidul's sap is passed on to trees in Silancium. But this year, it seems the person in charge didn't do a very good job. I'd like you to go check. Bring the Sap Pot from under the roots of the tree in the Ghost Valley.	The tree sucks up the sap from the Sap Pot and grows leaves. The animals then eat these leaves and become prey to other predators.  That's how life is sustained in Chantra, spreading the blessed energy of Shinewood little by little into Silancium. Well, that's what the plan is anyway. That's why the Sap Pot has been buried there. Go to the tree in the Ghost Valley, dig up the Sap Pot from under its roots and bring it back to me.	Let me see. Give me the Sap Pot... That's weird.

He was right in front of me, but he disappeared quickly and I haven't seen him since. I'm afraid he may have been killed by a monster, but I can't lose him like this. Will you help me? Well, yes. I think we could be excellent partners. Let's start by destroying twenty-five Fire Ghouls in the Ghost Valley in the northern area.

They say they've killed the traveler and showed me his ring as proof. It's a memorable ring. Big opal on it. I'm sure he'd never give it up. Of course I refused at first. Have to keep up my professional reputation. But they'll be back, and they'll kill me if I stand in their way again. To be honest, I'd give them the item, but I don't have the key I need. As usual, I gave the key to the traveler. The thieves said some monsters took the key. They want me to break open the safe. I can't do that. Can you search for the key? If monsters really did take it, a traveler like you should be able to find it. Search for the Travelers’ Safe Key after destroying the Duriven Searchers in Death Plain.

I was bringing it into the village and hid it in the forest to keep it away from others' eyes, but I completely forgot where I hid it. Do you want to know where it is? Hmm, I remember it was under a rock south of the upper part of Salarmis Garden. What's the treasure? It was a Ring of Blood Relatives.	Did you say I should retrieve it because I'm the person who hid it? Well, frankly, you're the person who needs it, not me. I think it's only natural for you to go get it. So bring the Ring of Blood Relatives hidden under a rock south of the upper part of Salarmis Garden. No complaining.	Oh, you found it. How is it? Isn't it wonderful? Well, yes.

If Risky gets through the open gate and steals the ring again, everything we've done so far will be in vain. You have to defeat Risky in the Death Plains! Everything will be fine if you catch him and prevent anyone else from touching the gates.	Rasky on the Death Plains will be hard to kill, but I'm sure you are up to the task at hand.

If you've been to Battle Square, you've heard of her. Yes, that Basarah. The one who ruined Battle Square. No one is really sure where she went after that. According to some rumors, she's following a traveler in a black robe. I heard she left everything behind in Syllancium when she took up with him. If that's true, she must have left behind the Medicine of Immortal Life. I want to get it from her belongings, but I need more information. I recently heard Traveler Elba talking about Basarah with a traveler from the east. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village and ask her. Pretend you're just happening by.	Don't forget. Go to Traveler Elba in front of the south gate of the village.	Oh, do you know the story? So far it remains to be confirmed.

I've heard so many stories, I can't remember clearly. Oh, yes. Now I remember the story about the Medicine of Immortal Life. I heard the map of where it was hidden is somewhere under a rock West of Death Plains. He said the Map was hidden there. It can be just a rumor, so I can't guarantee it.	Do you want me to tell you one more time? Bring the Map from under a rock west of the Death Plains, if it is there.	Wow, was it really there? Amazing. Can I see it? Wow, this is great. I envy you.

It acts as a boundary with Syllancium and gives water to every plant in Shinewood. The water of the lake is sinking very slowly. We don't know why it's happening, but I think the monsters in Syllancium are planning something. They live in the eastern part, so that's the direction they'll come from. We may find some evidence near there. The monsters would use a Talisman of Absorption. Can you help me? Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	There's a possibility you won't find it there, but my instinct tells me you will. Find the Talisman of Absorption under a rock east of Angspel Lake and give it to Judge Fariannel north of the village.	I heard it from Mybling.

Instead, as the mental power of the residents in the village becomes stronger, the magic squares protecting the village will also grow stronger. So bring me five hundred Small Mana Potions so they won't be mentally fatigued while safeguarding the village.

I'm sure it would be very strong magically and could be used for various purposes, but I hate to see Golems destroyed for such a frivolous purpose. It is such a foolish thing even though it is true. A nobleman of Dulan asked me to get some for him. I owe him a big favor, so I couldn't refuse his request. Can you help me? Bring me thirty-five Soul Stones. The best way to do it is using your Ransacking skill on the Golems south of the Desert Boundaries, but you can get them by other means. You may also be able to buy them.

While I fight with the Golems, I can be attacked from the rear. In fact, since I beat a group of Robatoms for the villagers, I've been their target whenever I've been in Silancium.

The names of various places even originate from that problem. Wanderer Plain is an example. This area in Silancium is especially dry, so travelers often get dehydrated and wander around in a daze. Experienced travelers are prepared for it, but there are always unskilled ones from Tullan who are never heard from again. Ironically that's because so many people travel here from Tullan to search for their friends who were lost in the desert. If we ignore this problem, Ellore will turn into one big crowd of mourning, ill-prepared travelers vying for the chance to be the next ones to go missing. I cannot express the degree to which they are bothering me. As an Elder, I have to solve this problem as soon as possible. I asked Traveler Elba at the south gate of the village to help me, but I don't think she'll be able to manage it alone. She can only join one search party at a time. Help her, please!

Have you heard of the Caravan Master Scrouge? He may be the richest man on the continent. I heard his daughter will travel through Silancium to visit him, living in Terranoa. Everybody travels through Silancium but there is a big problem with this journey. She's a bad traveler. She can't use weapons or magic, and furthermore, she scares easily. On top of that, she is so stubborn that no one can stop her. Scrouge failed to change her mind, so he asked me to guard her, but I can't protect a reckless girl in a red hood. I need your help. You are the only person who can do this in Ellore. Can you help me? Thank you so much. You should leave immediately, because she already started.

1364	Legendary Snake	Dangerous Plot	Ellore; Farianelle	1		60				1			<Judge> Farianelle	<Judge> Farianelle				A giant snake named Brambattle is sleeping in Silancium. Some say it's just a legend, but it is a truth in the documents of the Elementals. Brambattle is sleeping deep in the desert and it will wake up someday. I saw something strange in the desert today. I saw someone preparing for a magical ceremony, so I got close to him. He attacked me, then tried to run away. I caught him without any difficulties and interrogated him. He told me surprising things. The traveler in the black robe gave him directions and he was carrying out one of the revival ceremonies for Brambattle. It was hard to believe such nonsense, but his behavior was too systematic and careful to be that of a madman. I want to see if what he said was the truth or not. According to him, a Talisman of Weather is attached to a rock in the Fallen Hills Area. If it's there, I'll believe him. Can you bring it?	Bring back the Talisman of Weather from a rock in the Fallen Hills Area, please.	You brought it. Give it to me. Hmm, this is the Talisman of Weather. It's a strong Talisman used in releasing something from magic or imprisonment. It is not a specific talisman to awaken Brambattle, but......

Furthermore, the job is fairly well done. The traveler in a black robe? I've heard rumors of him for a long time, and he must be very violent. Anyway, I'm not sure, but hundreds of Weather Talismans may be in Silancium. Even if we know where they all are, it will take several months to collect them. Hmm. Poison must be controlled by poison. In this case, we'd better wake a sleeping lion. Hahaha! I'm sorry for talking for myself and laughing, but it is funny. Okay, this is the job for you. Get thirty-five Clay Fragments and go to Pilgrim Nox at Jamushi's Seal. You can get the Clay Fragments in various ways but you will get them most effectively by using your Ransacking skill on the Windboar Imps south of Beacon Village. Ask Nox about its effects.

Still, it poses grave problems for the villagers, and many have suffered. It will be difficult to defeat him with our bare hands as it is locked in magic. So I asked Trujillo to find a way to defeat it. I think he's had time to come up with a way, so go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south of the village.	I asked him to do it a long time ago, so he must have made some progress. Stop being lazy and go to Magic Trainer Trujillo south inside the village.	Oh, right. I've heard about it. But what can I do?

Hrmph, I can't sell this as it is, so run to Magic Trainer Trujillo and ask him how to purify the Ring. He is just south of the village.	What, do you want to see me change into a bat?! That's not right! Hurry up and run to Magic Trainer Trujillo just south of the village and ask him how to purify this Ring!	That foolish thing. He has gotten himself into trouble once again. He loves money too much, that's his problem. Well, I know all merchants are greedy, but I will have to think about whether to purify the Ring or not.																																								1.

A long time ago, a sorcerer tormented by Silk Eyeballs made it. The person wearing this ring must kill ten Silk Eyeballs to break the curse. Morien doesn't have to do it because it was you who first found the ring. So defeat ten Silk Eyeballs north of the Plunder's Plains. Of course, then you should run to Item Trader Morien in front of the east gate of the village to verify the condition of the ring.	Isn't the sorcerer smart? He tried to seek his revenge by using others. But of course, he cannot be praised for such an idea. Well, defeat ten Silk Eyeballs in the northern part of the Zeno Plain. You will have to run to Item Trader Morien in front of the east gate of the village to verify the condition of the ring.	Oh! The dark light disappeared from the ring, and it seems that we owe it all to you. Thank you so much. I was worried something really bad might happen. The ring? It disappeared suddenly. As you said, maybe it will appear again when it finds someone else as a sacrifice.						803	Silk Eyeball	10																																1. Defeat ten Silk Eyeballs.	4	2.

So our villagers raise boar and deer. But at their hearts they're still wild animals, so if we manage them poorly, they turn fierce. Garot, over by the Graves of the Dead, is good example. He was smart. One day he broke the fence and escaped, forming a group with other boars. Our village has invested a lot in raising Garot, so we can't just let our investment go. We need the money. I heard if we can defeat Chief Garot, then the other boars will naturally just return to their home. That's exactly what you have to do. Defeat Chief Garot at the Graves of the Dead and bring back Garot's Tooth. We are hoping that the other boars will return if they see Chief Garot's Tooth in our possession.	This is a broad plan, and it feels bad sacrificing a Garot. But if we can gain much by losing one Garot, then it's a worthwhile sacrifice. Defeat the Chief Garot at the Grave of the Dead and bring back the Garot's Tooth.	Good job! With the tooth you brought back, the hunters can hunt down the Boars.

I want to have that traveler's Rusty Dagger back. Defeat the Blood Cubes east of the Grave of the Dead and bring back the Rusty Dagger.	If you're going to stand there like that and not move on, I will have to ask someone else to do the quest. So, last chance.

Bring me a Red Moth's Eye, you will find the moths west of the Northern Temple.	Oh, this is the Red Eye. Actually, this is my first time seeing it in person. How miraculous.

Go ask where the Sword of Darkness might be hidden and find it. I saw it fly toward the center of the village where Elder Brusoto is.	Go to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village and ask him where the Sword of Darkness is.	The Sword of Darkness? I don't know what that is. But recently I saw a sword flying through the night and it gave me such a horrible feeling. I will punish the person who made such an awful thing. Why does he think such a thing is needed in this peaceful world of ours? It can't be you, right? Well, that sword...I need to think for a moment.																																								1.

I can only give you a vague location. If you find the Sword of Darkness somewhere inside the village bring it to Blacksmith Brin, just northeast inside the village.	Did it kill anyone? No? Oh, that's good. I have nowhere to go if I get kicked out of this village. In other nearby villages, they don't have much, but at least every village has a blacksmith. Haha.

The King has chosen you as the Shadow Warrior to work for Trilgard. Your role is to look into everything happening here in Golundo, and report important events to the King. I have assisted Shadow Warriors like you for a long time in this village. Of course, this was a secret to others. This post was created since it is difficult to see what's happening in all of Golundo all the time, given the distance between Golundo and Trilgard. Every time a new Shadow Warrior is designated, I test whether he is worthy or not. So you need to show me what you've got. All you have to do is defeat ten Vipers north of Valbur Hill.	Don't forget. What you have to do is defeat ten Vipers north of Valbre Hill.	Now I see why you were chosen. The King certainly has an eye for talent. I'm relieved someone like you is working for Trilgard.

There were no obvious causes for the fire or any hint of arson, so they must have been created by magic. Whenever things like this happen, we always turn to Alchemist Bura for help. Go to Bura northeast inside the village.	If the fire was made by an ordinary person, water would have been enough to extinguish it. But a fire created by the power of magic can only be extinguished with the power of magic. There are many ways, but in cases like these, we always turn to Bura for help. Go to Alchemist Bura northeast inside the village.	These types of things always happen. So just seeing you here, I already know who has sent you. Wait a minute.

This time, it was likely the result of somebodys curse. To stop the fire, I need material to make a talisman. I need Ice Flowers, which grow in the plains near Golundo although there is a problem with that. The Ice Flowers grow near the Grunt Peninsula, where Viper Warriors live. They really like Ice Flowers, so they will undoubtedly fight tooth and nail to protect them. So if you could defeat ten Viper Warriors for me I can quickly grab the Ice Flowers.	Without the Ice Flower, there can be no alchemy. We can't extinguish the fire, either. Do you understand me? Hurry up and defeat ten Viper Warriors near the Groont Peninsula. That's the only way I can collect the Ice Flowers.	Good job, but close call. Still, we reached our goals, didn't we?						71	Viper Warrior	10																																1.

Now we have to make him pay for this. He has something called the Water Jewel, which he keeps hidden out in the rocks. It allows him to summon awesome power even in places where no water exists, as long as he possesses the jewel. If he loses the Water Jewel, his power will diminish immediately. He will learn his lesson if you can find me the Water Jewel among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	It's our only chance. He'll have no power if you get me the Water Jewel from among the rocks south of Balbre Hill.	The revenge is complete. Do I want to destroy him? I have no interest in doing that.

He's concerned Golundo isn't more influential in the region. The King, like our ancestors, is always worried about small local tribes getting too defiant.  So naturally he was furious when Goblin Chief Ciroro started showing up right near Golundo. We need a plan to defeat Ciroro. A frontal attack on his people will never work. But one on one we have a chance. We should start by defeating Bashiva, Ciroro's right-hand man. Bashiva lives near Kandia Mine.	Even seemingly weak and useless Goblins can become threats if they gather in large numbers. So they are the ones we need to look out for most around this area.

I heard from Magic Weapons Merchant Charlize that if I can get the Comfort Talisman, I will be able to sleep soundly again. I think I can get it if you can help me out. Goblin Rangers have the Comfort Talisman, so defeat the Goblin Rangers at the Bala Plain and bring me the Comfort Talisman.	I think they might be suffering from the same thing as us.

563	Ice Festival	Opening of the Festival	Golundo; Brin	1		10				2			<Blacksmith> Brin Ironsmasher	<Elder> Brusoto				Today is the opening day of the biggest festival in Golundo, which features the historic Ice Procession. Today commemorates the day when our ancestors landed on Shiphead Seashore, made their way through the icy road on bare feet, and established Golundo after defeating the Yeti and enduring other hardships. People come here from all around to enjoy the festival, so I'm usually quite busy selling things today. Oh, I've been wasting your time. Please go to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village. The festival will start at his command.	It is useless wasting your time here. Go to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village. The festival has now started.	I was wondering if you would come. I don't want to force you. Taking part in the festival isn't mandatory. But the festival will lose some spirit if a talented person such as you doesn't take part in it.

After a fierce battle lasting seven days, the dragon finally fell, but not before taking many lives. The opening ceremony of the ice festival commemorates their deaths. Obviously there is no way  we can get the Ice Dragon to come back, nor would we want it to. But in remembrance, we use a Whitedran to symbolize the dragon. I have released one near Solcid Stone Case with a Red Magic Jewel on it using magic. Each participant should try to find and defeat the Whitedran. You should try as well, and retrieve the Red Magic Jewel. Go and start your quest!	Defeating the Whitedran is not difficult. It's certainly nothing compared to what our ancestors fought. So don't hesitate. Go and defeat the Whitedran near Solcid Stone Case and retrieve the Red Magic Jewel.	This is it, the Red Magic Jewel. Retrieving the jewel symbolizes we have retrieved the blood our ancestors have shed. It also means you are approaching the level of our ancestors. Now, take a break to prepare for the next quest.			1304	Red Magic Jewel	1	451	Whitedran		1304	Red Magic Jewel	30	1																												1.

I am referring to the Temple of the Land south of Solcid Mountain Range. Of course, the temple they build wasn't anything compared to what you see nowadays but our ancestors who bowed at the temple received the Revelation from the Earth Elemental to stay in that land. You should follow in their footsteps. Go to the Temple of the Land in the southern area and bow at the temple. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	You should not disrespect our ancestors' traditions. Hurry and go to the Temple of the Land in the southern area and bow. Then bring back the Box of Sacrifices.	The box symbolizes the Elemental's Revelation. Like the Revelation, no one knows what's in the box. You should not look inside either. It represents our ancestors' belief in what they had not seen. Great! Now only one level is left.																				172359847	1429	Box of Sacrifices	1																	1. Find the Box of Sacrifices at the South Temple past the Solcid Stone Case.	6	2.

At the time, our great ancestor Ankalatutomb killed ten Yeti with an axe and he set up a post there. Now it's time for you to show us you will become an Orc as strong as him, and that you will follow his example, his courage. Defeat ten Young Direwolves at the Algema Basin. This quest is nothing compared to what our ancestors had to go through.	It is a true victory to best a strong enemy. Defeat ten Young Direwolves at the Algema Basin.	It's not something you can see, but your valor is ingrained in you. It proves you've got more power within than any of the things you've done or brought back during the festival. It also represents the spirit of our ancestors. Though the Ice Festival is over now, your valor will remain forever. Good job!

I think it will be possible to conquer the lands they dominate one by one, because the two places are far apart. Conquering Ciroro is more urgent as he recently started gathering his tribe members. It will become more difficult if he gathers more soldiers, so I think now is the best time to face him. Go to the Bala Plains and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	He will not be defeated easily, but you can do it! Go to the Bara Plains and defeat the Goblin Chief Ciroro.	You've made it! Your ability is amazing! Although chaotic, I heard Ciroro's power is quite threatening. Thanks to you, the Goblin's power is now weak. There is only one thing left now.

Meizo is weak at the moment because of Chakdol's betrayal, so I think this is the perfect time to root out his power. Before you start on this quest, I need to tell you one thing. Meizo has a Jewel called Reptile's Eye. The King wants to have it, so go to the Groont Peninsula and bring it back after defeating the Viper King Meizo.	You have no time to waste! Go to the Groont Peninsula and bring the Reptile's Eye back after defeating the Viper King Meizo.	You have killed two chiefs! I think I need to reassess your ability!

Some items that were coming to me have disappeared as well, so it bothers me a lot. I would like to ask you to go there for me and find out what happened. Go to Merchant Burbur of Nortop Village and ask him what's going on.	The cause is pretty obvious when items disappear in such a small village like that. So go to Merchant Burbur of Nortop Village.	Are you saying people think I'm a thief? That's absolutely not true.																																								1.

You haven't said it exactly, but I can tell by the way you look at me. The truth is, a huge rock fell from the sky and a part of the warehouse was smashed. Young Lycantos began taking advantage of the situation, stealing things like crazy. Since they outnumber the villagers, it is almost impossible to guard the warehouse against them. Please defeat ten Young Lycantos outside Nortop Village. We can talk after you do that for me.	I told you that we can talk after the quest is completed. Defeat ten Young Lycantos and kick the rest out of the village.	Wow, your ability obviously outpaces others. No wonder Golundo selected you to come here. Oh, right, you're not here for that.

But I couldn't just stop working until the warehouse was rebuilt again, so the monsters are getting in and stealing items in the meantime. It would be great if I could stop them, but that's difficult at the moment. Of course, Zion would think his items are so precious, but to us, our work is more important. So, would you help us out? I had an item stolen, a Golden Scroll. I wanted to send it to Safe Keeper Tess of Golundo. She begged me to get it to her, even if getting it back was incredibly difficult. Fortunately, I attached a magic talisman to it, so I can track its location. The Golden Scroll is among the rocks south of the Belliga Basin. Please find it for me.	I think the monsters that took it might be the Bronzedran. They have a natural ability to see magical items. So, find the Golden Scroll among the rocks south of the Belliga Basin.	This is it! This is the scroll that will turn anything into gold just by reading it. But it's pretty useless. You can't read the language written on the scroll with just earthly knowledge. In short, it is useless without a sufficient level of knowledge. Still, there are people who are searching for it, so we will be completing our quest just by delivering the scroll to them.

On the outside, the wound seems minor. But since the monster was poisonous, the villager is now in great pain. There were Antidote Potions in the warehouse, but all were broken when the rock fell onto the warehouse. Of course, I have one, but since I'm a merchant, I can't give it to you for free. If you have the ability, buy an Antidote Potion from me. It will be very useful to them.	Don't think I'm stingy. I mean, I am a merchant. If I give things out for free, I'll go bankrupt. So buy one Antidote Potion from me. You'll be able to save that villager's life.	That was close. He was barely able to survive the poison, but he's breathing comfortably now. I owe this all to you.

Find and defeat the Young Manticore outside Nortop Village and retrieve the Magic Leather. Then deliver it to Merchant Zion in the center of Golundo.	Your last quest is a bit difficult, isn't it? Find and defeat the Young Manticore outside Nortop village and retrieve the Magic Leather. Then deliver it to Merchant Zion in the center of Golundo. Then he will be satisfied.	I was dying to see you, and here you are in person! Great job! But I can smell Manticore on the leather and there's some fur on it. Oh, is that what happened?

The Manticores have highly sensitive noses and they come for food from hundreds of miles away, following the scent.

We raised them with care, so it makes me sad to see them like this. The cost of the feed alone as we raised them was so high. Well, destroy twelve Young Hydras northwest of Dark Wave Village.

The Royal Envoy guarding the claw seems to have met with disaster on his way to Golundo. He should have arrived some time ago, but there's no sign of him. Of course, he disguised himself so travelers wouldn't notice him, but it's strange he's taking this long. This region is in chaos at the moment. See what happened by asking Blacksmith Mino Fireeye at Nortop Village just in case. There is one thing I need to do for him, and I would like you to do it for me. Defeat eight Skeleton Shamans at the Algema Basin.	Where in the world is the Royal Envoy? Defeat eight Skeleton Shamans at the Algema Basin and then go to Blacksmith Mino Fireeye at Nortop Village. But keep in mind, if you don't do anything for him, he won't tell you anything.	Merchant Zion of Golundo sent you here? Did you hear about the Skeleton Shaman? Oh, you did it? What else is happening?

Now that I think of it, a very suspicious traveler hung around outside the village for a while. He didn't come in, he just sat on a rock for a bit, then disappeared. You might find something among the rocks southwest of Nortop Village. If you do find something there, you should take it to Merchant Zion in the center of Golundo.	This is all I can say. The only way is to recklessly search for the luggage among the rocks southwest of Nortop Village. If you do find something there, it would be wise of you to take it to Merchant Zion in the center of Golundo.	Oh, the Envoy is already dead.

That document is more important to us than anything else. Defeat the Skeleton Knights and retrieve the Royal Envoy's Oder.	Good job! The Royal Envoy's Order says, Although I cannot allow Golundo to be defeated by the Yeti, it is impossible to carry out a full-fledged operation because of Kuhn. The document also says to protect Golundo, but at the same time collect intelligence about the Yeti whenever possible. This is just about what you've been doing so far.

The Undead are persistent and scary. It's difficult to fight them. They don't get tired, so if the battle persists, we will likely lose.

It's on sale in my item trading market, but it is anything but ordinary. I don't know who gave it to me to put on sale, but it is clearly something special. In fact, it looks like the Jewel Lizardman Thief Aria recently stole from Kuhn's Noblemen. I am not completely sure. I don't want to get into trouble because of this. So, deliver this Stolen Jewel to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village and tell him the truth.	You must not forget to tell him it's not my fault. Deliver this Stolen Jewel to Elder Brusoto in the center of the village and tell him the truth.	I was getting sensitive because of Aria's conduct, and this is indeed a surprise. I didn't even think their items would come into our village. Are they thinking they can sell things in this village they can't in Kuhn? I think I need to look into this situation further.

He hid in the Dark Wave Village and posed as a traveler, so that's why we think he may have hidden the item there. I need you to find out about that as soon as possible.

I have to hide it somewhere inside Grimlore. You should carry out the final task for me. Go to Dadhal and destroy ten Thief Scouts. They will be of use. I will be with you.	This task isn't difficult, but it can save us. Go to Dadhal and destroy ten Thief Scouts.	Where should I hide the box? Well, hide it in the least likely place, of course. This is the trick of an adventurer. Dadhal is home to many thieves. No one ever tried to hide a treasure there, but I did. No one will think to look there. Nowhere could be safer.

We're completely lost, though, because we can't give it to him. We're just too afraid of his wrath. So can you do us a favor? Since we can't ask the Commander for help, we are thinking of going to Guild Leader Lagran. He'll accept my terms if we include three pieces of Broiled Bear. He absolutely loves broiled meat! You have to go get these three pieces of meat somehow and give them to Guild Leader Lagran east of the city.	We are really desperate. What if Commander Burke knows about this? So please give three pieces of Broiled Meat of Transcendence to Guild Leader Lagran east of the city.	Wow! There must be a reason for giving me this tasty food. Hmm...

What lies within is unknown, so that makes it very intriguing. But Maxo is a smart fellow and keeps the chest far from his home. His own subordinates may be after it, too. He hid the chest underneath the Relics of Battna Site. You need tremendous courage to go near the Ruins. But I bet you qualify for the job. Get the chest back.	What are you doing?

If you destroy eight Flamebears near the Old Mine, we will ransack the corpses and find the Money Chest. This'll mean you've caught the criminal as well, right?	What's the wait? Are you confident you'll be able to find him among so many Flamebears? Go now and get eight Flamebears near the Old Mine and we will look for the Money Chest.	We could find the chest...

Bring Earth's Eye from under the rock west of the Elemental Water.	Don't you think it is a good idea to keep balance between powers? The machine is now screaming, so bring me Earth's Eye from under the rock west of the Elements Waterfall.	Oh no! It blew out even before you brought it. I have to start again from scratch. I don't have magic jewels that can power the machine at the moment, so it will take a while. Would you help me again? Ha! Ha! Think of it as a valuable investment for a great invention.

Go to the Adventurer Fodon northwest of the city and ask if he will come to our aid.	The rumor must be true. Even I now work for Trilgard, but I am still an adventurer.

You should go to Trilgard, where Adventurer Tarisild has information on lost magical tools. You can't just go straight there, though. I heard he won't give information unless visitors bring Gadius' teeth. Can you do that? I have no choice but to trust your ability. I'll tell you what to do exactly. Go to the Verark Basin, hunt down a Gargoyle Gadius and get its teeth. Then go to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	He is not a material man, but for some reason he may ask you for it. So go to the Berarch Basin, hunt down a Gargoyle Gadius and get its teeth. Then go to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	You are the member of our tribe who became involved in the Gnome's matter. Even though evil power emerges, I don't think heroes or adventurers like yourself will just sit around and do nothing.

You should focus on something else.  Gambler Windeius has in his possession some excellent Gnome's magical tools. He won't just give them to you though. He's using them as collateral on his gambling debt. I'll see if I can find the debt's owner, but we don't have much time. Let's see if he'll bargain for them. Find the Magic Talisman at Barandike Fortress 1 and give it to Gambler Windeius, who's south of the city. It's a fair trade.	The Magic Talisman originally belonged to a minority tribe at Baran Dyke Fortress who resisted giving it out in the past. Each one had great value, but now little remains. You may be able to get one while the ransacking continues. Find the Magic Talisman, which Windeius wanted to have, at Baran Dyke Fortress and give it to Gambler Windeius south of the city.	Oh, this is the Magic Talisman! How did you know I wanted to have this? What? You want to exchange it for the magical tools? Well, I'm not really the tools' owner. I'm just keeping them as a guarantee, so I can't exchange them without permission. But I can ask the owner. Wait a second and I'll ask him.

His might and valor had no equal, but he had too many enemies and they finally caught up to him, joining together to slay him. Just before he died he asked to be buried with his sword, and his last wish was honored. Unfortunately, that's not the end of the story. Every night of the full moon, the sword escapes from his tomb and lurks in the streets. Anyone who happens by, whoosh! Scary, huh? You could bring peace to this frightened city. First find the Cursed Sword in the Warrior's Tomb by the Temple of Time. Then take it to Warrior Weapons Merchant Traltran south of Trilgard Square. He'll explain why, heh.	It's very simple. Go to the Warrior's Tomb at the Temple of Time, find the Cursed Sword and give it to Warrior Weapons Merchant Traltran south of Trilgard Square. Not to me.	Hah, you really don't know anything. He asked you to do this because he owed me something. Apparently you fell for his line and brought the sword to me. Well, it's understandable. There are all kinds of dreadful stories about this sword. Dipo must have wanted to stay as far away from it as possible, that arrogant coward. Oh, there's no need to make that face.

I already sent a message to him by a carrier pigeon, but he might not have received it yet. Go to Elder Brusoto in the center of Golundo and bring me his reply.	I already received the letter from Trilgard, and I also received an oracle from the Earth Elemental. I sent it to Trilgard, but apparently, you and my reply crossed paths.

Destroy Spriggan Combatants at the Village of Rest and bring back the Sealed Box that holds the Document of the Elemental's Revelation. Give it to Mayor Prosto east of Trilgard.	While you're here, Hydra Gorer is causing more damage. Hurry to the Village of Rest, destroy Spriggan Combatants and bring back the Sealed Box holding the Document of the Elementals' Revelation.

Go north of the Infinite Mill and destroy the Hydra Gorer.	Only the chosen one is able to defeat Gorer. Keep that in mind and go to the Infinite Mill and destroy the Hydra Gorer.	Everything is accomplished under the protection of the Elementals. We are now safe thanks to the Earth Elemental. Job well done.

Spriggans are pretty dumb. I'm sure they'd be really surprised to see Orcs all of a sudden! As a matter of fact, Peddler Keep Gothear proposed this plan. He even brought us the blueprints to make a flying machine from Engineer Marudos. He made a lot of contributions. Anyhow, we need some parts to make the flying machine shown in the blueprint. One of them is the gland of an animal that makes things lighter. Right now, the only monster we can get it from is Forest Buckets living near the Village of Rest. If you destroy fifteen of them, experts will collect the glands from their corpses.	Be careful not to be caught by their boss, Barto. He can be very frightening when angry. Go quickly and destroy fifteen Forest Buckets living near the Village of Rest before Barto finds out what you're up to.	Thank you. Some of my workers were injured by Barto, but we got what we needed. You want to know what we'll do with the glands? They're the fuel for our flying machine. Marudos' blueprint says it'll float up in the sky with a few of these.						19	Forest Bucket	15																																1. Destroy fifteen Forest Bucks near the Village of Rest.	4	2.

Long ago, before we even came to Chantra, there was a flying city in the skies above Chantra. It was destroyed in a terrible battle and fell far to the north. Parts of the city scattered across the land. Some say those pieces still have the Talisman of Flight, that kept the city in the air. One of them was apparantly found by a rock near the Dusty Creek of Silancium. Please go and get the Talisman.	It's very precious and sought after by many. Looks like the Spriggans have noticed what we're doing. Hurry to the rock near the Dusty Creek of Silancium and find the Talisman of Flight.	Great. Now that we have most of the materials, I just need to focus on some details. I hope this will work as planned. You can take a break and get ready for the next step.

The Spriggans found out about our plan and stole the flying machine just before its completion, only moments ago. No doubt, this is a huge setback. We lost all the materials we gathered so far. You know.... I can't just let this happen. Let's follow them and reclaim the parts. You need to be a pursuer in this. Go to the Village of Rest and destroy fifteen Spriggan Combatants to cut off their line of retreat.	Nobody knows what they might do when they're up against a wall. Let's hurry. Go to the Village of Rest and destroy fifteen Spriggan Combatants to cut off their line of retreat.	Oh, all our efforts were in vain. As soon as they saw us, they torched our flying machine. Since it was made of wood, it burned very quickly. We can collect the other materials again, but there's no way to get another Talisman of Flight. We'd better give up this plan. But it's not over yet. No, we have to fight more fiercely. Please wait here until I need you again. Just don't relax quite yet.						302	Spriggan Combatant	15																																1.

Bring me ten bottles of Sour Seasoning. You can buy them from a cook.	It may sound weird to you, but we think this is a good idea in its own way. So, go get ten bottles of Sour Seasoning for me.

We were talking about who's better as a trainer, and this Archer Trainer Gorgan said warriors were too stupid to develop fully. You know what I did? I challenged him and we made a bet. If I succeed in finding something he hides, he says he will never underestimate warriors again. All I have to do is simply find the thing and prove my senses are as good as an archers. The problem is, I'm supposed to find it, but I can't leave right now. I have a bad hangover, so I need your help. Gorgan said he hid a Water Bottle beneath a rock near Elemental Waterfall. As soon as you locate that Bottle, go to the Archer Trainer Gorgan south of Trilgard Square.	This is a really important bet, a duel. It would be a piece of cake if I wasn't feeling so sick. Then I wouldn't be asking you for anything. But please, as soon as you find the Water Bottle hidden beneath the rock near Elements Waterfall, go to Archer Trainer Gorgan, south of Trilgard Square.	Hmm, this is the Water Bottle. Why did you bring it here? Oh, Kildemor told you to bring it to me. That sounds suspicious... Well, I'll take it anyway, but I'll definitely laugh if I find out Kildemor wasn't the one who found it. But that's not the problem right now. There's something more important.

The problem is, I was supposed to hunt down Skeletons and collect fifteen Skeleton's Bones as evidence by now. But my bow broke in half last night. I'm sorry to ask you, but please do this for me. You can't tell Lytillo, of course, but can you get those bones using your Ransacking skill on the Skeleton Knights in the Algema Basin? When you have fifteen, show them to Magic Trainer Lytillo north of the city.	This isn't the act of a coward. I just have no other choice. Use your Ransacking skill on the Skeleton Knights in the Algema Basin to get fifteen Skeleton's Bones, and show them to Magic Trainer Lytillo north of the city.	You came on behalf of Gorgan? Well, he must have been pretty mad at me. I was just joking, but now he sent the Skeleton's Bones. Anyway, you must have travelled a long way.

I'm furious. He mocked all the sorcerers of the past, present and future. He said sorcerers know nothing of the world and can't even find precious objects hidden in corpses. He was clearly throwing down the gauntlet. I vowed I would get what he wanted after destroying some monsters, but I have to attend some urgent matters right now. I would appreciate it if you could do it for me. Kill Spriggan Warriors and find Kildemor's Stolen Food. Then, of course, go to Warrior Trainer Kildemor south of Trilgard Square to show him the evidence.	If you take too long, people might think I'm an unqualified trainer. So destroy Spriggan Warriors, take Kildemor's Stolen Food back and show the evidence to Warrior Trainer Kildemor south of the city.	Uh, this is my food. Spriggan Warriors stole it from me. And you're saying Kildemor got it back? Hmm... He may not be that bad after all. Of course, he's still not in my league. Ha-ha. Anyhow, I beat Gorgan, and Kildemor beat me.

But I can't waste my time on Kildemor's stupid idea. I saw what you did as a go-between with the three trainers. None of them did the work on their own, so nobody wins.

And Spriggans were Gnomes originally. In fact, I never knew they would misuse the information like that. It's not really my fault! Doesn't that make sense? Well I guess I provided the fundamental cause. So let me tell you something to make up for my mistake. The origin of the magic the Spriggans cast in the Temple of Time is an ancient magic. You can find out what it is from the Scroll at Barandike Fortress. Find the Scroll and give it to Mayor Prosto east of the city, but tell him nothing about me.	You know it's not a good idea to waste time here. Hurry up. Find the Scroll at the Barandyke Fortress and give the Scroll to Mayor Prosto east of the city.	What is this? Oh, I see.

I don't really pry into others' secrets. You just hurry to the rock near the Elements Waterfall and find the Book under the rock. Then give it to Adventurer Tarisild southeast of Trilgard Square.	Oh, this is the Book I've been seeking for such a long time. Very precious records. The records of the ancestors who came to this land and the culture of the new land they found. This is a very rare book, and there are more than a few people who want it. He might have felt something and hidden the book there.

He needs an 'Omnipotent Herb,' a very important ingredient. It grows only in the land of Humans. There's a small village south of Tullan and north of the Buktributs Mountains. We need to ask the Chief of the Village for help. The place is called Low Wind Village. Humans have long suspected the village of helping with Usus' Riot, but I've known the Chief a long time, and I know he can be trusted. Anyway, go to Chief Aliti of the Low Wind Village in Membreathen, give him this Scroll of Unlimited Food and tell him what we need. The village usually suffers from food shortages, so it will be a welcome gift.	It's still not very pleasant to go to the land of Humans, but the journey is essential for this quest. Please give the Scroll of Unlimited Food to Chief Aliti of the Low Wind Village in Membreathen and tell him about the Omnipotent Herb.	You came here in spite of great risks. Mayor Prosto of Trilgard sent you? What's going on? Hmm, I've heard of Omnipotent Herb. It has powerful effects, but it's nearly impossible to find. It grows underground and appears only once a year, but I'll give it a try. Mayor Prosto does make some difficult requests.			1383	Scroll of Unlimited Food	1																																			1.

If you can take out twenty Spriggan Chasers at the Qualt Camp near the King's Hunting Field, I'll look around for the Herb.	It's dangerous for both of us, so you'd better stop wasting time. I mean it. Hurry up. Destroy twenty Spriggan Chasers at the Qualt Camp near the King's Hunting Field.	The Omnipotent Herb wasn't there.

He accepted your present instantly and agreed to the exchange, but he's worried the Herb might be stolen in transit and says he'll send it eastward by balloon. So, if you just wait in Trilgard, the Herb will be there. No need to worry. You don't believe me, do you?  If it doesn't arrive there in time, I'll take the full responsibility. Just don't worry. Deliver my message to Mayor Prosto, east of Trilgard Square.	You haven't left yet. You still don't believe me, but he will. Just tell Mayor Prosto east of Trilgard Square what I said.	Well done. What happened? Hmm. Well, who knows what will happen, but I trust Aliti. He'll take care of everything along the way, and at least that person with the Herb won't just cheat us.

The balloon carrying the 'Omnipotent Herb' was caught in some turbulence and crashed near here. I don't know, the Spriggan's might have done it. Now that the balloon is lost, we need to retrieve the Herb. The crash site is north of the Tent Village of Rest, pretty close to where the Spriggan's rampage around. I want you to destroy fifteen Grizzly Bears in the area while I recover the Herb.	Just pretend you're out there hunting so the Spriggans don't realize what we're doing. Don't be nervous. Take a cue from the name of the area and just pretend to be resting peacefully. I'll recover the Herb. You destroy fifteen Grizzly Bears north of the Village of Rest.	That was too close for comfort.

I'm giving you a good opportunity! What are you doing here? Oh please, just get going. When you get the Scale of Divinatory Sign after destroying Marylith Nobles at the Advance Road, go to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	Seeing that you have the scale, Jean Kiev must have sent you here. I told him not to do that more than once... As you are already here, let's just take a break and talk. What did he tell you about me? Everyone knows I'm not the person Jean Kiev describes, although it's true Koop has had his way for far too long. But I'm not the one to change the situation. Perhaps a traveler like you. Or your colleagues. Shall I take a look at your future?

It seems like they want to pick a fight, but Scar said no good will come from getting angry, so I decided to use my brain a little. Moon Elves care a lot about their appearances, and they frequent Stylist Domion's establishment in Trilgard. It would be easy for her to get some information without arousing their suspicion. I already told her what to do, and she's going to help us, but she wants Gold in return for information. I want you to give fiive hundred Gold to Stylist Domion northeast of Trilgard Square, and deliver my message to her.	We've already talked about this, so stop dilly-dallying and do what I say. Give five hundred Gold to Beauty Artist Domion northeast of Trilgard Square and deliver my message to her.	You don't have to say anything. I know why you're here. You have the money? I don't want you to think I'm materialistic, but I'm in some trouble and need the gold. It can be tricky getting information from Moon Elves. They have a very strong sixth sense, so it's easy to raise their suspicion. But I'm an Elf, too, so my senses are just as good as their's. Wait for a bit.		500																																						1.

She had a special mission to carry out in Silancium and was attacked by monsters while doing it. They didn't tell me directly, but I overheard what they were talking about while doing their hair. They said the monsters that attacked Dallain were Hobgoblins from the Pandaram Plateau. They tracked her into Silancium and ambushed her, stealing three of Dark Sentio's Records. That's what they're looking for. What are you going to do? I think you'd better start looking for the records, too. If you find them and give them to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of Zylok, he'll be really pleased.	Even a fool knows Koop has a quick temper. Retrieve three Dark Sentio's Records from the Hobgoblins at the Pandaram Plateau and give them to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of Zylok.	Did you get some useful information? Um, what are these? Oh, you must have heard of the name, Dark Sentio! It's the Power of the Elementals of Darkness. If the book is written under that name, it must be of great value!

If I attack them again, I'll have to pay for it. I know better than that. You think I'm an idiot? So, I want you to hunt them down for me. The worst of them are east of the Red Stone Road. I want you to kill twenty of them.	Apparently, you don't want to help me. Are you ignoring my request? If not, you'd better hurry up. Kill twenty Ghost Thieves east of the Red Stone Road.

Magic Trainer Telecaster knows how to deal with this kind of thing, but he won't do me any favors. His followers aren't big fans of mine. Someday they'll get what they deserve, but right now I need his help. Go to Telecaster southeast of the village.	Why are you still here? Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village, and tell him about my situation.	Koop's been cursed? The rash you talked about is called the Curse of the Dead. It's not from living beings.

That's why he hates Ghost Thieves. But the Ghost Thieves in Syllancium all have their own stories, too. They were Humans who were destroyed in the Battle of Monsters six months ago. Human warriors came here through the portal. Some of them returned safely to their own land, but others died in Syllancium. They have lingering ill will toward the Orcs, and now Koop has fanned the fire. I'd better find a solution. First let's appease those souls. Bring me fifteen pieces of Dragon Meat. You can get them using your Meat Carving skill on the Dark Wyverns in the Dusty Creek.	What are you doing? Shouldn't you be gone? Bring me fifteen pieces of Dragon Meat. You can get it using your Meat Carving skill on the Dark Wyverns at the Dusty Creek.	Good job. Dragon Meat is tough and gamy, so it's not good for eating, but it has strong natural powers.

Let's talk about it after lifting the curse. They said they attached a Talisman of Curses to a relic south of Milieu, where Koop couldn't find it. Retrieve it and give it to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village. He should burn it himself.	As long as the Talisman stays where it is, the curse on Koop can never be lifted. Find the Talisman of Curses on a relic south of Milieu and give it to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village. Tell him to burn it himself.	You've been there? What's this talisman?

Indeed, Koop's most precious possession is a weapon. This should do the trick. It would be better if he could present it to the Ghosts himself, but I'll do it instead this time.

But Security Chief Koop doesn't really care about security, rather he encourages the mercenaries to do bad things. My safe is not protected from the mercenaries either, but I don't know what to do. I recently lost my Gold Nugget. I may need to negotiate with them. Can you go to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about my offer?	This is urgent. Hurry to Mercenary Scar at the north gate of the village and talk to him about this matter.	I heard about Kellog's problems several times from other people, but even the mercenaries have their own opinions. There's no evidence we did it, you know. That's jumping to conclusions.

The one who told me turned a deathly pale and said the book is the Ancient Document of the Ones who Pursued a Great Power. But a single document couldn't have that much magic, could it? Anyhow, I have to go to finish the negotiations. Moon Elves have implanted these things called Beast Jewels into the foreheads of monsters in the area. They can control those monsters at will now. If things turn bad, they could attack me with those monsters, so I'm going to bring my men with me. Oh, and I'm going to deal with this beforehand. I have an order for you. We're going to meet Moon Elves at the Baran Dyke Fortress. Destroy the Dark Wyverns there and bring me five Beast Jewels! Understand?	The meeting is set. You'd better hurry.

I didn't think much about it at that time, but now that I heard Koop met Moon Elf envoys,  I remembered my friend said those bodies were dressed in Moon Elves' official uniforms. But these so-called envoys never asked any questions about the dead ones. So I did a little bit of investigating myself, and I saw them talking to some unknown Orcs more than once. What I'm saying is that they may not be real Moon Elf envoys. If those bodies were proven to be the real Moon Elf envoys, Koop might have second thoughts, right? The evidence is buried in Syllancium. Moon Elf envoys always carry Karafel's Imperial Sword and Belange's Document with them. My colleague must have buried them together with the bodies. You'll be able to find them under a rock north of the Wind Plains. When you find them, give them to Security Chief Koop at the west gate of the village and tell him what I said.

But rats came into my storage shed and ate half of what I made! I don't even know if I can make all this food before they get here, but I don't want to mess up their schedule. Can you give me a hand? Ah, thank you. I need some more ingredients to make their food. Please bring me ten pieces of Gargoyle Meat. Use your Meat Carving skill on the Gargoyles in the Verarch Basin of Ezerock.	I have to pay special attention to travelers' food. They tend to get much more fatigued when they're alone. Please use your Meat Carving skill on the Gargoyles in the Belliga Basin of Ezerock and bring me ten Pieces of Gargoyle Meat.	Thank you.

They don't know what's dangerous or not, and don't have much information about monsters. They just wanted to scrap with anything they ran into, and now they're stuck somewhere out there, surrounded by monsters. Travelers are always getting into trouble, but it doesn't feel right to sit here doing nothing knowing lives are at stake. I mean, they are my clients... I wish you could help me. Oh, great! Thank you! Go south of Dusty creek and destroy twenty-five Mobet Largewings.	I can't deny I'm thinking of my business, too. If a cook sent a rescue team, people would talk about it, right? But first and foremost, I'm asking you to help them for their own sake. Now please go south of Dusty Creek and destroy twenty-five Mobet Largewings.	They were lucky. They're all injured pretty badly, but none of them died. Still, there's something ominous about them. I'll find out why.

One of them was carrying all of their possessions. He didn't even know his bag was torn while running from the monsters. They desperately want their Lost Money Pouch. Even if they can't get back the rest of their items, they need their Money Pouch. You're a fellow traveler, so you do understand, right? Think about it. What if all the items in your inventory and all the Gold in your possession just disappeared... Now, you know what I'm talking about? So, please do this for them. Destroy Dreadwolves west of the Dusty Creek and retrieve the Money Pouch.	If you're going to do it, do it quickly please. Think of your own youth. Please destroy Dreadwolves west of Dusty Creek and retrieve the Money Pouch.	Oh, the Money Pouch. Great. Now they can continue to travel. Worst case scenario, they might have ended up as Koop's slaves for the rest of their lives. They drank and ate quite a bit on credit so far. I guess they haven't been through hard times before. I know you've been working hard. It's all to get those youngsters headed down the right path.

When I saw how unprepared they were, I gave them some advice and found out they had a story. One of their good friends went on a journey to Syllancium and died there. Now they're here trying to recover his remains if possible. I know they're reckless, but the reason is rather moving, isn't it? So I said we would recover the traveler's Ashes for them. Yes, I know. I didn't have a plan. But I knew you could do it. Please recover the Traveler's Ashes from a rock in the Dusty Creek.	The friendship and loyalty of these young people really makes me cry. It's beautiful, isn't' it? So, you've got try hard. Please recover the traveler's Ashes from a rock in the Dusty Creek.	Now the dead man will be back with his friends.

Although it's not pure Gold, the arrowhead is Gold with strong magical powers. It's always a hundred percent accurate and can be a real lifesaver in an emergency. This precious arrow was stolen by a thief Harpy. I'm so angry.... but that won't help me find it. It's time to show my talent as a hunter and tracker, I guess. I'll follow its traces. This is quite urgent because we're in real trouble if he runs too far away. So, bring me one Hindseeker Armpads. Mine is too old and useless. Can you do me that favor?	Armpads are the only Orc defensive device we Satyroses can wear. Come on, hurry up and get one Hindseeker Armpad.	Hey, you're late! Oh, I shouldn't say that when you've done all the work. Thank you.

You search the Dusty Creek. It's vast and empty so it's easy to find even minor evidence. Among tree branches or rocks is possible. I don't know what kind of trail he might have left, but since we found a Bloody Feather here, you might be lucky enough to find more. Come on... Let's follow his trail and track him down.	Well, I haven't left yet, but what about you? This isn't good... We'd better hurry. Go search among the tree branches or under rocks in Dusty Creek for proof, like a Bloody Feather.	Hmm... My guess was right... This feather is just like the other one... Nothing in the North, so he must be going South. Let's think about his position...

Destroy twenty-five Marylith Sailors north of the Dusty Creek up near Wind Plain and open the way for me.	Quick, they're getting away. Go kill twenty-five Marylith Sailors west of Dusty Creek.	I almost caught the thief! I was hot on his heels thanks to you. But the thing is... Do you see my injured leg? Ouch...

After driving away those Moon Elves, I didn't feel very relieved. So I did a little research and concluded that I'm not the one that should have Dark Sentio's Record, although neither do those Moon Elves. Actually, it's useless for me. I don't care about Dark Sentios at all. So, I need help from Telecaster this time. He would be better... no, he knows more about magic. So, take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	This is a big favor from me, so you have to let him know about it. Take Dark Sentio's Record to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	A completely unexpected guest! And unexpected gifts, too! Oh, of course I know about the book. I know more about this book than anyone in the village. And about recent events, too. I was actualy nervous that Koop might do something rash, but he dealt with it wisely. Give me the book.

With the help of ancient sorcerers, we can open a tiny crack to talk to Evil Dark Hall, which exists between Dark Sentio and the World of the Elementals. We'll ask them to take this document back. We need fifteen pieces of Wolves' Fur to do so. You can get them using your Ransacking skill on the Direwolves near Grand Crimson.	Again, what we need are fifteen pieces of Wolf's Fur.

While I was out in the plain searching for materials, monsters attacked me out of nowhere. Usually, they can be spooked with a single spell and they run off, but this time they were quite determined. Maybe they were trying to get Dark Sentio's Record. I had it with me. I heard the Moon Elves first lost the book after being attacked by monsters. There's something going on... The necklaces the monsters had on really concern me. I am sure those are... I really need your help. I'll start the ceremony to bring out the Dark Hall, but I'm worried about monsters. Can you defeat the Frost Thieves south of the Wind Plains and get the Necklace of Darkness?	Remember that while you're thinking, the clock is ticking. Defeat Frost Thieves south of the Wind Plain and get the Necklace of Darkness.	Thanks to you, the ceremony ended in success and Dark Sentio's Record is gone now. So, what about you? See... I was right... This is called the Necklace of Darkness. It appears along with travelers in black robes.

He tries to unite my opponents and increase his power to usurp my position as the Security Chief, or Village Chief... Whatever...He wants control over this village. Such a plan is poison to this village. I'll send him a letter of warning. Can you run an errand for me? Deliver this Warning to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	What's the delay? Do you look down on me, too? Do you want to be kicked out of the village? If not, get busy. Deliver this Warning to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village.	Oh... What in the world is this? Hmmm. He's always been excessively paranoid and here it comes again. This isn't the first time he's done this. Never mind... I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm not maneuvering myself for anything.

The Mist Slasher symbolizes revenge to Orcs in the southern area. They give this as a token of revenge. Well, Castor isn't an Orc, but I'm sure he gave it to me with that intention. He would never just give me a present. How should I pay him back? Right... I'll give him a curse that is most fitting. You'll find a tombstone lying underneath a small pond north of Wind Plain. A Ring of Curses is hidden under the tombstone. Deliver the Ring of Curses to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	I know the ring exists, but I don't know the story behind it. You should find someone else to tell you about it. Please don't bother me anymore. Just get the Ring of Curses beneath a tombstone north of the Wind Plain and deliver it to Magic Trainer Castor southeast of the village.	This is what is known as a Ring of Curse, but that name is somewhat misleading. The tombstone commemorated a former Thief King in that region. Although he was a thief, he was a champion for the less fortunate and weak. After his death, his body was cremated and his followers buried his ring, placing a tombstone above it. When the great troops of Orcs swept across that area, they all protected that monument with their lives.																				165609585	2615	Ring of Curse	1																	1.

I feel like I should play a trick on him! Can you give me a hand? Koop hates me so much, but he can't do anything to me because I'm a sorcerer. He has great strength for sure, but is somewhat afraid of magic. This Ring of Curses seems to be a symbol of his nervousness about me. I'll make use of his fear. You can find Ghost Thieves north of the Dusty Creek. One of them has a Meaning Talisman. Get the Talisman and go to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village. Tell him it's a Ghost Thief talisman. He will just freak out. Hahaha...	Why a talisman from a Ghost Thief when just a normal talisman would do? Because there's a legend about them just like the one about the Thief King. Actually a Ghost Thief's Talisman just soothes the minds of those who leave their homes. But some travelers think they're cursed. So get the Ghost Thief's Talisman north of Dusty creek and give it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village, telling him where it came from.	What is this talisman? What?

It's quite simple. In Shinewood they have a wonderful perfume, far better than any you have encountered. Merchant Girin of Ellore has it; she won't sell it to an outsider, but she might give it as a reward for a personal favor. I understand she has been having difficulties with the Centaur Windrunners northwest of Ellore in the Shinewood. The villagers don't want to cause trouble with the Centaurs, but if an Orc were to do it... well, that's a different matter. I'll bet Girin will be very grateful once you kill ten Centaur Windrunners. When you're finished, go northwest of the village to find her and tell her what you've done; then you can ask for the Fine Perfume.	Orcs are always the ones chosen for hard, gruelling work, so stop frowning and hunt down ten Centaur Windrunners northwest of Ellore in Shinewood. Then go to General Merchant Girin northwest of the town and ask her for the Perfume.	I heard there was an Orc fighting Centaur Windrunners and it was you! You're very courageous, but what are you fighting for? Oh, the perfume? Well, I never told Kuro I would give the perfume in exchange for Windrunners. I just said they were bothersome and nothing more. They're residents of Shinewood, too. Ah... But I can't let you go empty-handed when you've come all the way here. What should I do?

Delfaras merchants, who have the perfume, are staying at the Elder's house. But you can't buy it with gold because they only exchange goods. They don't sell them. So, I found out what they wanted. They want the hide of a monster. That's all they told me. They're probably afraid I might intercept it if they told me too much. They just told me that it's hidden somewhere in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreathen. Maybe the hunters left it when Spriggans raided the area. So, go get the Monster's Hide.	There's no other way you can trade with them. They're really picky, but sometimes even general merchants have to deal with them because they have goods others don't. Get the Monster's Hide in the display rack in Redderhood in Membreden.	They look just like other skins, but there must be a reason they want it so badly. We Merchants should be well-informed.

Well, even if you're not, you have to be a thief this time to help Shakran. The ideal metal is Illuminite, harder than cast iron, but as light as a feather and as flexible as a willow branch.

Maybe they were so worried about us that they are going to Trilgard along the north road via the seaside without passing through Zylok. But I can't just let them have their way. We need a really huge army, not a small one. I think we need help from the Guilds, so go to Guild Leader Jean Kiev and ask him for help. Of course, you can't go to him empty-handed. Bring ten Marylith's Scales. The Scales are of excellent use when decorating the guild marks. You can get them by using your Ransacking skill on the Marylith Countesses near the Wasteland.	Like I said, there's no need to talk now, just do what I asked. Go near the Wasteland, destroy Marylith Countess and bring back my Money Pouch.	Koop seems to be overzealous these days and now he's planning a nonsensical scheme. Do you think I'm crazy enough to lend the power of my guild for such a ridiculous thing?

Hmm, I see... That's not an easy decision... Should I tell you or not.... Honestly, I want that shield... Give me a minute.

That day, when Seena's display rack was pillaged, I wasn't there because of other urgent matters. I mean, I am somewhat responsible for what happened that day... But just a little bit responsible, that's all. Anyway, I had no idea Seena's place was robbed, and was patrolling the neighborhood. I saw someone drop something into a box around General Merchant Kuro's store at the village center and then just disappear. It was weird. One would normally pick it up, but he was in a big hurry and just left. Thinking back, I guess he might have been the thief. I don't know exactly what he dropped, but it looked like a Dagger at a glance. If you happen to find it there, take it to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	This is all I know, so get out of here. Just go get the Dagger in a box near General Merchant Kuro's store in the village center and take it to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	Oh... Is this what the thief dropped? That means my mercenaries weren't patrolling properly. So who can I trust? Anyway, thank you.																				165675218	2533	Thieves' Dagger	1																	1.

I don't want to talk to him, but he has to take responsibility. Take this Dagger to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village.	I've already heard about what happened to Seena. I feel sorry for her, but it's her fault she didn't manage the place properly. Gee... Scar the Mercenary... What was he doing? Hmm... So now we're being blamed. Ok...

Actually, we've discovered Seena's Vase was stolen by a Windwing Harpy. That means what Scar said was wrong. Ha! How could a mercenary prevent a thief that just flew away? I'm sorry. Anyway, that means there's one thing left to do. Destroy Windwing Harpies in the Wasteland, retrieve the Ancient Vase and deliver it to the Item Trader Seena east of the village.

Huh, but don't you think it's interesting that this corps is to chase the missing Usus? You do know there's a huge reward placed on it. So, I'm joining the Trilgard Adventurer Corps. But they're asking a fee for participation. Actually, I don't want to be bothered by that, so can you help me? What I need to give... are ten pieces of Venison.

I heard he is quite dangerous. I don't mean it in a bad way. He's dangerous not because he is cruel or ruthless, but because he always attracts trouble wherever he goes. Many travelers don't like to work with him. It's a surprise that you didn't know that as you are a traveler yourself. But I don't want to be rejecting an entrant without a good reason. So, let's just do it like this. I once found the Rigid Chest at some ruins with some travelers. We tried our best to open it but we all failed. On top of that, it was too heavy to move, so we just left it there. The location is the well southwest of the Blood Shelter and the chest is inside the well. Deliver that Rigid Chest to traveler Kaneiosis south of Zylok and tell him he'll be accepted if he opens it.	I know this is rather mean, but if Kaneios is as they say, he should fall for it. He's rather ...dim. Hmm, anyway. Get the Rigid Chest from a well southwest of the Blood Shelter and deliver it to traveler Kaneios, south of Zylok.	So, how did it go? What's this chest? Right... So, what should I do? Open the chest? But what's inside? You don't know? OK. You just brought it. Wait there while I try.																				159056065	2580	Rigid Chest	1																	1.

I heard Adventurer Tarisild's hobby is collecting Crossbows. That means five Wood Crossbows would be good. Get five Wood Crossbows and take them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	There are other competitors, so you have to hurry. Otherwise, the entry period might end. So, quickly get five Wood Crossbows and take them to Adventurer Tarisild north of Trilgard Square.	What? This is nonsense. I heard he was odd, but never imagined a bribe like this. Why bribe someone to enter an Adventurer Corps? Well since you've already delivered it I'll accept it, but I promise I'll distribute them to other adventurers so this isn't a bribe. I won't accept Kaneios.

That axe has been in his family for generations. If Skita notices this, I'm as good as dead. But I'm a professional, so I can't just do nothing. I decided to make a replacement. With our unique traditional way, I think I have one chance to recreate the axe. But I need a Blazing Crystal, which is extremely hard to get. At least in Ezerock and Grimlore. So, it looks like you'll have to go a long way to get it. If you go to the Limelight area, west of the place where the Humans live, there is a place called Gnome's Cave. Go there and you will meet Miner Picken Firepick. He might be able to supply it.	It's going to be a really long journey, so there's no time to waste. Go to Miner Pickin Firepick at the Gnome Cave in the Limelight area and ask about the Blazing Crystal.	You've come all the way here and I have nothing to serve to you. Please accept my apologies. Tell me, how is Balo... no, Falcon doing? We haven't corresponded for so long. By the way, why are you here? Blazing Crystal! oh.... Is that what he's looking for? Yeah, it's a Fire Elemental Stone that's been buried underground for a long time. It soaks up the power of the Land Elemental for so long it can't be used as a proper Elemental Stone, but it produces flames forever, so it's very useful for anything needing to be processed in fire for a long time. They're so rare, they're very hard to get. I don't have one right now but I'll try to get one. I've heard rumors about one recently somewhere...																																								1.

I collect the ingredients for Cook Basil, and he cooks for me. Of course, the hard part is getting the ingredients. I can't leave because I'm so busy right now. My birthday is today, and Basil won't cook for me after today. So, can you get the ingredients for me? I need Oramis Fruit. This fruit comes into season once the Desert Flowers wither. It's very hard to get, but I saw some Desert Flowers by a river southeast of the wasteland, so you can probably find one there. Please give it to Cook Basil northeast of the village.	It's just one day. My birthday is over tomorrow. Are you going to ruin my birthday? Find an Oramis Fruit under the rocks southeast of the Wasteland and give it to Cook Basil northeast of the village.	This is Oramis' Fruit. What's it for? You must be kidding. You're not? He really wants me to cook with this? Well, of course I can do it, but it's very complicated. Oramis' Fruit is poisonous, so there's a huge process I'll have to go through to detoxify it. It's just a pain overall... But If I don't cook it today, he'll keep nagging me for another whole year. So, let me think about it.																				159121825	2610	Oramis's Fruit	1																	1. Get Oramis Fruit under a rock southeast of Poppy field.	6	2.

Find the Structural Map of Milieu attached to a slate at the Stone Pillar south of Curse Valley. There is no other option.	Thank you. It may not be fatal, but you've been injured quite a bit.

Kill ten Winged Centaurs east of the village and use your Ransacking skill to get ten Centaur's Horns. Then bring them to Item Trader Seena east of Zylok.	I don't know what she wants them for. We're only traders. Go and kill Centaur Airbornes east of the village and get ten Centaur's Horns using your Ransacking skill. Give them to Item Trader Seena east of Zylok.	Welcome. Thank you for coming such a long way. While you were gone, I did some research and found out I needed an elixir to save my sister because she's been under the influence of magic for so long.

Go to Alchemist Deathnote in the village center. Unfortunately, I don't think he'll give us the answers easily. However, he is fairly cash-strapped these days due to all his experiments. Go give him five hundred Gold, then ask him. But, sorry, I don't have any money. You'll have to earn that money yourself.	He's not a materialistic man, but he won't reject your offer since he needs more money for his experiments. Give five hundred Gold to Alchemist Deathnote at the center of the village and ask him to do this favor.	Hmm... Well, I'm in dire need of money for my experiments, but I can't just accept this. Tell me, you want something from me, don't you? Ah... Right, I once heard about it from Sorcerer Mormorine. Although he's not a member of the society, I can ask him.

Their headquarters is located on Ever-Snowy Mountain. Not everyone can access the mountain, but there's also a building in Tullan for Elders' meetings, and I think we can find the shield there. You will see a building, north of Tullan, with boxes scattered around it. It looks shabby from outside, but is a warehouse full of all kinds of materials, all an elaborate ruse. Search those boxes and find the Heaven Covering Shield. Deliver it to traveler Dag at the center of the village and your job is done.	The Heaven Covering Shield is said to have the power to dispel clouds that hang over Millieu. Some say the shield was part of Millieu originally. Anyway, find the Heaven Covering Shield from the boxes in the building north of Tullan. Give it to traveler Dag at the center of the village.	This is the Shield.

Just know there is one. I've decided I want to improve the way I look from now on, but Zylok is such a small village, receiving help from a neighbor usually means widespread rumors. Therefore, I want you to go to Stylist Domion on the east side of Trilgard and deliver my message. Don't go empty-handed. Bring a Knowledge Ring. She doesn't work for free.	Don't forget you'll have a hard time in Zylok unless you help me. Keep that in mind. Get a Knowledge Ring and go to Beauty Artist Domion east of Trilgard.	Well, a citizen of Zylok can easily go to other beauty artists in the village. It's not that I mind it, but mercenaries have far worse skin than travelers like you. Even the ancient therapies can't promise quick improvement. And it's harder to erase scars from battle. But what can I do? I can't ignore clients.

The best and quickest way is to make a lotion for her. I need some special ingredients to purify her troubled skin. Usually, trees in cold regions produce good water for whitening, and there is one tree that generates the best whitening solution in Grimlore. It's the sap of the tree we call the Pure White Water. Bring the Pure White Water from a tree south of Crowcross in Grimlore. That can soften Ska's skin.	You can't just get as much sap as you want any time. We're going to great effort to keep that tree alive, so you have to hurry. Otherwise, you won't have a chance. Bring me the Pure White Water from a tree south of Crowcross in Grimlore.	Good job.

They started chanting some spell and my body was frozen. I couldn't move. Then they wrote something weird on my body with dye. How did I escape? Monsters attacked. I can't really remember.  Anyway, they were eaten by the monsters. I almost got eaten as well, but managed to escape in time. I don't know who they were. Evidence?  There is none. But the monsters ate them, so maybe you could find something out if you cut open the monsters. The Young Turkavens in the Village of Seethe ate them. You might be able to obtain find one of the Necklaces the men in masks were wearing. Take it to Security Chief Koop in front of the West gate of the village.

Don't give me that look. I was presented with a riddle by Shocker! What was the riddle? This is what he said, It brings death during sleep, but is the friend of deer when awake. What is it?

An Elf millionaire named Maxilliaren didn't know what to do with all his wealth, so he runs a contest. He hides all kinds of expensive items around Silancium and people race to find them. Anyone can participate, but since you have to deal with monsters, mostly just travelers get involved these days. Sure, go to Guild Leader Jean Kiev in the center of the village and sign up before it's too late. He's Maxilliaren's agent in this village. Did I mention, you need to bring ten thousand Gold with you for an entry fee?	Don't forget to take ten thousand Gold. Go to Guild Registra Jean Kiev at the center of the village and sign up for the contest.	You're too late. Too late! I'm all out of Confirmation Tickets! Oh, you're stubborn. Are you that interested in treasures? Many have gone home empty-handed. So take my advice and just give up!		10000																																						1. Aquire 10,000 Gold.	2	2.

Hmm... There is one thing that comes to mind. I think I heard Magic Armor Merchant Quentine has given up his search. I think you could get his Confirmation Ticket if you go see him.  Go to Magic Armor Merchant Quentin north of the village.	You're really annoying me! Go to Magic Armor Merchant Quentin north of the village!	A Confirmation Ticket for the treasure hunt?

So give up. As you know, he's a Pilborg. You don't know what he'll do if he gets angry. So stop nagging like you are now. Stop making trouble.  Oh, you're a pretty tenacious fellow. Well, I guess it's not impossible.  What if you brought his favorite thing in the world. Meat? Hmm, give that a try. But also get thirty-five Tough Cobwebs and take them to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita North of the village. That might give you a chance to bargain. You can get them by using your Ransacking skill on Zebuses at the Dead Cliff.	Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita, who's north of the village, once said he wanted to create a weapon out of cobwebs. Use your Ransacking skill on the Zebus that roam the Dead Cliff and get him thirty-five Tough Cobwebs. I'm sure he'll be pleased.	Hmm, those are cobwebs, my favorite. The Confirmation Ticket? No, I like Tough Cobwebs, but I can't exchange them for the ticket. Of course not, but they do look nice. Fine. Give them to me first. I'll consider an exchange. Don't worry.

I guess you could say he's jealous of Usus. Anyway, that's why he likes to get information on Usus. He thinks it will bring him closer to taking Usus down! I've heard the followers of Usus are planning a conspiracy in Ivory Grave Village. Take this Letter and deliver it to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village. You must tell him it's from me!	I asked you to take this Letter to Security Chief Koop in front of the west gate of the village.	What's this? Kuro sent me a letter?

They're mortified to have lost so badly to monsters. I'd like you to become a mercenary for one day and avenge them. Your job is to destroy forty Raid Brans in The Span.	Now, don't be too nonchalant. Get a move on. Go destroy forty Raid Brans in The Span. Now!	Good job, but for some reason I still feel like something's wrong. We should've done it ourselves, I guess.

I must talk to the mercenaries. Whether it's because of something he did or something the mercenaries did, there must be a reason for their hunt.

They help them escape from whatever battle they might find themselves in. Get twenty Roundtrip Passports and go to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village.	Oh, my. I was frustrated by that incident, but to hear it's Barrakas' friend is worse. It doesn't change anything, though. Things like that don't matter to mercenaries. But... hmm.

He tricked the mercenaries by saying he had the Archons and extorted their money. Then when they found out it was a lie, he ran away. Yes, you could say it's the mercenaries' fault for being tricked in the first place, but what about the way he used them and kept them from doing their work? If Koop finds out, things will get worse. What can you do to help? Well, if you take care of these tasks, I'll consider it. Good. You must be brave to work for someone you don't even know. Your first task is to destroy forty Lamia Witches in the Death Plains. The mercenaries should've done this a month ago.	Are you trying to back out already? Then you won't be able to help Balakas.

They've been busy because of the Archons, so the warehouse has been empty for almost a month. At this rate, an uprising will happen. But of course, the young fellows don't think it's their fault. It'll be too late if we wait for them to realize what they've done. So you must fill the warehouse for us. Bring in twenty-five slabs of Hawk Meat.

Of course, Balakas' friend didn't kill him, but he did die while on the chase. The dead fellow's name was Zarkas. In order to calm the mercenaries down again, they'll want Balakas' friend dead, but then all your efforts would go to waste, so I've been acting as a mediator. To mercenaries, weapons are like their own children, but when Zarkas died, his weapon disappeared as well. He was killed by Robatoms in the Death Plains. Get Zarkas' Sword from them.

I don't know who their leader is, but I hear the monsters are following a strategy just like trained soldiers. The mercenaries are scared of them. Recently, Trilgard's nobleman Turgarb lost an Albileon to monsters in the process of importing it from Moon Elves. He's put out a big reward for the one who finds his Albileon, but no one has stepped foward, yet, because the monsters are so ferocious. I personally know Turgarb, so I can't ignore his pain. Isn't this what you've been training yourself for? Yes, that's the spirit. Anything is possible! So go to the Nobleman Turgarb near the South gate of Trilgard and find out about this incident.  Good luck!	I hope we're not causing more trouble by butting into other people's business. Well, you've offered to help. So go to the Nobleman Trugarb at the south gate near Trilgard.

Are you saying it's wrong for me to treasure it? Well, now I know where it is, and I plan to carry out a rescue operation. Since you came to help me, here's your task. Destroy thirty Redflag Sentries east of the Grim Reaper's Plains and clear a path.	What are you doing? Go destroy thirty Redflag Sentries east of the Death Plains.

Vellazuella flowers unfortunately don't grow in Silancium, cold Ezerock or Grimlore. They're abundant in Shinewood, which is why they have the best honey.  I've already asked Cook Setin in the south of Ellore, to gather the honey when it's time. She agreed to, if I bring her twenty-five Wind Stems. Wind Stems are only found in the land of Moon Elves.  You can use your Ransacking skill on the Poison Liches in Rucklia Amae in Vigoror to get them. Take the Stems to her!	A little bothersome? Yes, you have to go far, but it should be okay.

A long time ago, Silancium was ruled by the King of the Salam Kingdom. He built a big statue symbolizing the national strength of Salam. They called this the Big Statue of Tantlas. But as you can see, the statue is nowhere to be found. Relics from back then are found now and again deep in the ground of Silancium and are sold at very high prices. Recently, Mercenary Scar said he found a piece of leather in the desert that might be Tantlas' Belt. Tantlas' Belt is legendary because there are records that say 'it displays different qualities according to season based on alchemic principles.' If the piece of leather is really Tantlas' Belt, then it's quite exciting. Can you ask him if I could see it? He won't even talk to you if you go emptyhanded, so find five Wurt Zweihanders and take them with you. He collects weapons, so he should be impressed. Don't forget to ask him if he can show me the piece of leather.	They may not be enough, but we have no choice. Take five Wurt Zweihanders to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village and ask him for the piece of leather.	Deathnote sent you, hmm? Well, the piece of leather doesn't mean much to me so I could just give it to you, but since it's valuable to him, I would appreciate it if you offered me something for it.			520	Brut Zweihander	5																																			1.

He says he wants to take care of the recent conflict among monsters in Silancium and has requested my help.  But as an Orc and as a security chief, I can't do that. I actually want to interfere with the Humans' operations, but I want to do it covertly and plan to order the Guild Registrars to have the Guilds help me.

Well, I suspect Jean Kiev won't comply with my wishes easily, but go to Guild Registrar Jean Kiev in the center of the village and tell him my intentions anyway.	What's Koop up to?

I'll handle Koop, so let's go on with what we had in mind. I heard Skita helped the Humans this time. It might be a good idea to give him more evidence, making Humans more willing to battle the monsters. I hear the Ancient Relics of the Salam Kingdom are involved in this incident. I think it's important to retrieve all of them. According to what I heard, the Redflag Raiders on the Hawks' Plateau carry around items called the Crest of the Salam Kingdom. Whenever the Salam Kingdom went to war, they used this magical crest on their flags. It's supposed to make anyone standing under it fearless. I'm sure the monsters don't know about this, but it's still dangerous for them to remain in their hands. So, please find the five Crests they're carrying around and deliver them to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Don't be lazy. Get moving! Go to the Hawks' Plateau and find the five Crests of the Salam Kingdom. The Redflag Raiders have them. Then go to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita north of the village!	Oh, my. I was actually wondering what to do after hearing about the Crests. Thank you. But how did you know to bring these to me? That's just like Jean Kiev.

I sent one of my men to follow the envoys of Ellore just in case. Well, he reported back to me and said Riski has set off looking for them. As a result, they've hidden themselves in a cave in Syllancium and are awaiting help. I think you're more suitable for such a task, so please help us.

I'm just not too interested in what she did at Battle Square. But I just don't like sorceresses running wild. And I've heard she was seen in Silancium following a traveler in a black robe, with a trail of monsters in her wake. It's been chaos for the merchants. I sent some of my mercenaries to take care of the monsters, but they got in over their heads. To make things worse, most of my forces have gone to Kuhn because of the recent incident there, so I can't send any backup... except you.

You've come to get some information out of me. Well, listen. I trust you, so I'll tell you. I went to the Village of Seethe sometime ago and saw Kuro. He was putting a talisman on a rock near the lake inside the village. Then he caught me and read a magic scroll and put a curse on me! Because of that curse, I haven't been making any money lately. He called it the 'Beggar's Curse.' Anyway, that's what happened. He said I would get in trouble if I told anyone about it before he finished his 'task' and I believe him. What task? I don't know. That's all I saw. Well, now I've told you everything, you've got to help me. Go to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and see what he can do.	I fear I may have told you too much. Hurry to Magic Trainer Telecaster southeast of the village and tell him about my situation.	So that's what happened. Hm... Kuro is protected by Koop, so he maintains high status within the village.  It's understandable Seena fears him. I'm curious what Kuro is doing there.																																								1.

You said he was attaching a talisman, right? Then bring back the talisman, but before you go I'll cast a spell on you... There. It's done. Now bring the Talisman from the rock near the lake in Village of Seethe.	Hurry up before Kuro gets suspiscious. Get the Talisman from the rock near the lake in the Village of Seethe.	This is the Black Water Talisman. It effects water so that if you drink it, the more you drink, the thirstier you get. It's a kind of curse. The water of the Village of Seeth must've been contaminated with this talisman. Why would Kuro do such a thing?																				159121516	3457	Black Water Talisman	1																	1.

Go to Merchant Kuro at the center of the village and ask him about this incident. Be firm, he crumbles in front of tough travelers like you. He's a typical merchant, weak in front of the strong and strong in front of the weak.	Act quickly before Kuro finds out. Go to Merchant Kuro at the center of the village and ask him.	You're not here to buy merchandise? What are you saying? Why would I? Oh, I was wondering who took the talisman. It was you. Yes, I put it there. It wasn't to harm anyone. My only intention was to sell water.  Oh, don't look at me like that. I only have one rule I live by. Do what's profitable for me! That's it. I've been going through some tough times lately with this slump in my business. So I came up with this idea.The caravans passing through Silancium usually get water in Village of Seethe, but what if they couldn't? Then I could sell water to them.																																								1.

The curse I cast on Seena? Oh, I don't want to reverse that yet, since she squealed. Fine, don't hurt me! I'll tell you! It all depends on how well you hunt monsters. The curse I cast on Seena is ancient magic protected by monsters. You'll need to steal five Beggar's Curse Documents from the Big Venom Ghouls in the Wanderer Plain and give them to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	That's all I have to say. Steal five Beggar's Curse Documents from the Big Venom Ghouls in Wanderer Plain and give them to Item Trader Seena east of the village.	Oh, it's the Curse Document! Give it to me.

They're the ones I was going to work with for my water business, but you ruined everything!  What am I going to do? I'll...  Right. I'll have to ask for your help.  Please destroy forty Redflag Ironclad Soldiers in the Wanderer Plain and show him he shouldn't mess with me. I'm sure you're more powerful than someone who sells water.  Please help me!	Kuro is bad! But we don't have time to talk like this. Go to the Wanderer Plain and destroy forty Redflag Ironclad Soldiers. Help me stop worrying.	So everything's taken care of, right?

They started coming after 'that day.'  I don't know if headaches are also considered a disease, but once they start, they last for hours. I don't tell such things to other people, but I think I can trust you. A few years ago, I was kidnapped during my travels. I don't remember who kidnapped me or for what reason. I only remember an obscure image as if someone erased my memory. Maybe I know something they don't want revealed. I also lost a bag at that time. Recently, Kaneios said he got a small bag in Silancium. I'm thinking it might be mine. I want to get it back, but he's asking an outrageous price for it. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to act as a mediator. Go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and talk to him.	He's known to be a very impatient and rough traveler. Not a pleasant fellow, but I'm in an urgent situation so go to Traveler Kaneios south of the village, and tell him my story.	So Felicia sent you, eh? Hmm, she's always thought little of me.

Well, there's no point swearing at me. You know life is just like that for travelers like us. You should know that, being a traveler yourself. I'm just wanting you to bring me what I need. A few days ago, I found a dead merchant in Wanderer Plain. I swear, I didn't kill him. But I thought Monsters would take all of his belongings. To prevent that, I collected his things. He had forty emeralds. One emerald was very large indeed. Unfortunately, some monsters chased me and took the jewels away from me. The monsters were Redflag Ironclad Soldiers. Do you get the picture? Good,  go catch the Soldiers and bring all the Emeralds back!	What I want you to do is very simple. First, defeat the Redflag Ironclad Soldiers. Then, look for forty Emeralds.	Give me the Emeralds.

Could you look for the Copy of the Document near the rocks east of the Wanderer Plains?	Each time I touch a page, I can feel another piece of memory come back to my mind through my fingertips. Ah, I can remember why I was kidnapped and who kidnapped me. They must have been Dark Sentio's followers. They tried to steal the Document from me. I was afraid of that and I made a copy. This is written with Dark Characters so I can't read it now, but I would have known how to read it at that time. Maybe the followers erased everything. I will certainly learn how to read them again and regain my lost memories. I'll bring back what I saw and heard when I was kidnapped. If the opportunity comes to me, would you please help me?

Do you know about him? He was one of the greatest mercenaries ever. His whereabouts haven't been known since the last battle with the Golems. At least now we know he's dead. I recognize this scar on his head. Did you find his axe near his ashes? I'm talking about 'Leinwurt.' It was reknowned for its ability to split anything. You know, a mercenary values his weapon as much as himself. There's even a saying, to truly honor a dead mercenary, have a funeral for his weapon. We have to find 'Leinwurt' to pay our respects to this fine mercenary. The only clue we have would be these ashes. Take them to Magic Trainer Telecaster, southeast of the village, and ask him what he can learn about the Axe.	If Security Chief Koop knows about it, he won't like it. Magic Trainer Telecastor, just southeast of the village, is the only sorcerer we can trust. Take these Ashes to him and ask him where the Axe is.	Recently, I've heard of people finding the ashes of mercenaries all around the village. Thank you for bringing them to me. What can I do to help you?

There's probably some sort of connection between the groups of monsters. Have you heard about Harn? Him entering the fight makes the situation significantly worse. Harn's attacks on travelers will be devistating. Yes, yes, I know. You don't have to tell me about it. I didn't think things would develop like this. Anyway, we have to get everything back to normal, don't we? Defeat Harn on the Wanderers' Plains. I won't ask anything more of you after that.	You seem to be scared. Sure, Harn in the Wanderer Plain is very strong, but from what I know of you, you're strong enough to beat him. You have a good chance of winning. Don't worry anymore. Just go and fight him!

Bandit Village West of Silancium originally belonged to the Redflags. But the village has recently been taken over by other monsters. Redflags want to take the village back but they're not strong enough, so they asked us to help them. Although the Redflags live there,we won't be at risk because Zylok is so far from where the Redflags are. In addition, the Redflags promised us to give fair payment if we help them. I'll have the village prepare for the fight. Please deliver this news to Mercenary Scar in front of the North gate of the village.	Don't be late. Deliver the news to Mercenary Scar in front of the north gate of the village.	You intend to revive Bandit Village, right? Um... Bandit Village is very far from our village. I don't think there will be any problems for us, but some opposition is expected because some of the mercenaries have grudges against the Redflag Bandits. The majority of the villagers will also oppose the plan. I need to come up with a solution...																																								1.

First, let's talk to Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita. I once swore to be brothers with him, but we have become estranged for certain reasons since then. However, ultimately, he hasn't come to hate me. He will not refuse Koop's plan if I keep a low profile. Give him fifteen Black Poisonous Feathers. He has a weakness for feathers. I suspect that you know how to obtain them, but I will tell you how, just in case. you can can get them by using your Ransacking skill on the Sword Turkavens in the Fallen Hills. Bring them to the Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita North of the village. Don't forget!	Use your Ransacking skill on the Sword Turkavens in the Falling Hills to get fifteen Poisonous Black Feathers. Then give the Feathers to the Warrior Weapons Merchant Skita just north of the village, and give him my message. Be careful.	Oh, what great feathers. They're for me? Do you want something in return? Bandits Village? Well, Scar is right. We don't need to worry too much about Bandits Village. It's pretty far from here. But I am a little worried. I'll talk to my brother, Pilborgs.			2642	Black Poison's Feather	15																																			1. Obtain fifteen Black Poison's Feathers	11	2.

Before settling in this village, both Skita and Peabay were invincible mercenaries when they fought together. Of course, their fellow mercenaries were brave too, but just like them, most of the mercenaries scattered and settled here and there. If they are reunited, they will have immense power. I suspect that Skita has already talked to Peabay so everything will be easier than we thought now. Find two Moon Elves' Studded Leather Cuirasses and give them to the Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay, just north of the village. He will like them because he has lots of interest in other tribe's armor.	I will say it again, please listen carefully. The two Studded Leather Cuirasses are Moon Elves'. Don't forget that. You also must remember that they go to Warrior Armor Merchant Peabay north of the village.	Hmm... I can't say that... Oh, isn't this Moon Elves' armor? You've given me such a valuable gift, so I need to give you something in return... Um...  I already heard from Skita. You were the one who brought them into line. It's not easy to mobilize my men all together. I'm not even sure it's worth the trouble most of the time. If necessary however, I'll help. Don't worry, you can leave now!			2923	Studded Leather Cuirass	2																																			1. Get two Studded Leather Cuirasses.	11	2.

Although she didn't belong to the mercenaries, she supported us from the shadows when Skita and Peabay were fighting as a pair. If she joins us, we'll definitely be an elite fighting force. The problem is that she won't easily accept our offer. As I told you, since she wasn't a mercenary, she won't listen to me, but that doesn't mean she's impossible to reason with... A few days ago, a Moon Elf named Grahams died in the Lufut Land, but her crossbow hasn't been retrieved yet. In reality,  I hid it amongst the rocks in the Lufut Land to prevent it being found. I knew I could use it later. Maybe the crossbow will be enough to motivate Shakran. Find Grahams' Crossbow and deliver it to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran north of the village.	Of course, Shakran is different from Skita and Peabay, so she may not accept our offer so readily. Find Grahams' Crossbow amongst the rocks in Lufut Land. Then go to the Archer Weapons Merchant Shakran, just north of the village and give the Crossbow to her.	Oh, I know why you're here. I've already heard from Peabay. You brought that Crossbow to win me over, right? Hmm. Moon Elves' bows make nice ornaments, but there's one thing Scar doesn't realize about me. No one can make a bow better than myself. I'll accept the Crossbow, but...																				159055957	3482	Grahams's Crossbow	1																	1. Find Grahams' Crossbow among the rocks in Lufut Land.	6	2.

Don't treat me like Peabay or Skita. I'm much more clever than they are. What made them think I would help thieves? As you can see, my answer is no. But don't worry too much. The men I sent while you were on your way here have probably made it to Skita and Koop. Peabay and I have not only opposed the battle but also pledged to defeat Redflag. I'm sure Skita and Koop are deeply offended right now. Ha! Ha! You may still get involved in this, but you need to face up to reality. I'll help you realize it for yourself. I heard that the Redflag Bandits got some neighboring monsters to help fight as soon as Skita raids. If the bandits and monsters attack from behind, Skita's troops will run into trouble. Go east of the Wanderer Plains and destroy thirty Trancorpse Sins, rendering their strategy useless.	You have to hurry. Save Skita and Peabay from a crisis by destroying thirty Trancorpse Sins east of the Wanderer Plains.	What a relief! The Redflags will be running scared.

Alchemists back in the Age of Chaos created a monster named Mastook to guard against anyone becoming Archlord. Mastook was very violent and was drawn to anyone who possessed an Archon. Finally the monster was destroyed, but his eye survived. It has amazing powers of clairvoyance. I've heard the eye is somewhere in Syllancium, but Mormorine is refusing to lend me the book that might explain where it is exactly. So what I'd like you to do is steal the book. I've heard Mormorine is so worried about me taking the book he's hidden it in a jar in front of his house. He'd never suspect you. Bring me the Fables of Chaos, a book hidden in a jar in front of Mormorine's house north of Trilgard.	I'm asking for a favor. Steal the Fables of Chaos from a jar in front of Mormorine's house north of Trilgard.	Thank you. I hope I can find what I'm looking for inside the book.

But Mastook's Eye is not in the building ruins the Metal Golems protect, but rather, the Metal Golems themselves carry the Eye. However, Mastook's Eye can't be retrieved simply by killing the Metal Golems anytime. It can only be retrieved while the spell written in this book is active. Could you destroy Metal Golems for me? But first, let me cast a spell... Okay, it's done. I hope it works. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plain and find  Mastook's Eye.	Move before the power of the spell dissipates. Destroy the Metal Golems in the Wanderer Plains and retrieve Mastook's Eye.	Hey! This is Mastook's Eye. Um... I think we can find Lawrence with it... Yes. I need Mastook's Eye to find my lover, Lawrence, who disappeared. There's no other reason, but it'll take some time to figure out how to handle the eye.

If you take too much time, he'll probably come looking for it. So, return the Fables to Sorcerer Mormorine north of Trilgard, promptly.	Ah, I thought so...  I was just going to go to Juwan. Aren't you ashamed of helping her steal things? Anyway, I felt something ominous because I had already heard why she wanted this book. But you brought it back.

If you're right, Juwan probably doesn't know how to use the Eye yet. She may be keeping it in storage. What you need to do is to steal the Eye. Why? Well, you don't know how to use it either. Besides clairvoyance, Mastook's Eye has enormous powers of destruction. There's a story saying as many as ten thousand sorcerers were killed by the power of the Eye while they tried to catch Mastook in the Age of Chaos. The Eye is very dangerous. It can wipe out Zylok in a fraction of a second, but she was so fascinated she wouldn't listen to me. There's not much time. The eye has probably been absorbing the power of souls ever since it came out of the heart of the Metal Golem. Steal the Mastook's Eye from Juwan's storage chest, just west of Zylok.	You reap what you sow. In other words, you started this so you have to help finish it. Steal Mastook's Eye from Juwan's storage stand, just west of Zylok.	You brought it. I'm relieved.

I need your help because the plain is a dangerous place, as it's frequented by Silver Moths. Please guard me by defeating fifteen Giant Silver Moths south of Shump Village. Then go to the Villager Roten of Beacon village and explain to him.	Please. After defeating thirty Sword Turkavens in the Fallen Hills Area, take the whole story to Magic Weapons Merchant Juwan north of Zylok.	Ah... That's what happened. I was very perplexed, indeed.

I told this to Deathnote as he was passing by. He said if I needed help, just give the ring to him. So far I've just kept the ring with me because I was asked to, but something strange happened to me yesterday. I heard a crying sound coming from the ring. I can't stand it any more. I'd like to ask you something. Deliver this Ring to the Alchemist Deathnote in the center of the village.	Please deliver the Ring to Alchemist Deathnote in the center of the village.

With it, anybody can make a Golem his slave, but because it was made with Dark Sentio's power, it also brings a strong curse to the person who keeps it for too long. Another danger is that power coming from of the ring attracts Golems. Unless we do something, Golems in Silancium will eventually flock here. I'll risk my life for a just cause but I don't want to waste my life in vain. The ring must be destroyed. Alchemically, it will be possible but I need to do more experimenting. To do so, I need thirty Troll's Eyes. Destroy Rodam Breakers in the Vampire Village and use your Ransacking skill to get thirty Troll's Eyes. Take heart! It's all for the village.

Please do just what I explained.	You might think throwing the ring away would be enough, but it's of no use unless the ring is completely destroyed. It's been in Seena's possession too long.

As Security Chief, it's my job to handle this kind of thing, but I've got so much going on these days I can't give it the kind of attention it needs. I'm going to appoint you my deputy.

Well, it was near the western mouth of Windrill where I saw Falcon stabbing the traveler in the back. I was sleeping behind a rock. First, I thought it was a Redflag warrior I saw, but through a break in the sandstorm, I saw it was Falcon. He hid the knife in the crack of a rock. Hmm... Find the knife and confront Blacksmith Falcon with it. He's at the center of the village. There will be no way out for him. Could you do me that favor?	Was I mumbling?

My enemies are always looking for a chance to drive me out. I'm afraid this incident could work against me. Hmm, I just thought of something I could have you do. Telecaster said the monsters have a wand which will  react with the monster's evil spirits and make the Ghost appear. If the wand is destroyed, the Ghost won't come back. However, Telecaster will be ridiculed if there's no such thing. According to him, you can get the Wand from Duriven Fallens. Go ahead and get it if there is such a thing. Hahaha!	I have no expectations, but come back after you retrieve the Wand from the Duriven Fallens.	Ugh! This Wand... This is the Wand of Tarukra, who was one of my men a long time ago.

Now we have no other option than to reactivate it. I'll have to figure out how to do so. I can tell you what we need to do first. Bring me thirty Euriale's Talons.

I have done nothing to get them back yet because I didn't want to bother having to gather troops just for this mission. If you get the Horns back from the monster, you may keep them.

You'll probably end up destroying sixty Black Hawkarrows at the eastern mouth of Windrill.	Please make sure she doesn't notice what you're doing. I don't want her to be suspicious.

They say there is a battlefield there, where all tribes can come together as one. The field is generally called the Battle Square. The record of the Elementals says that the Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe who lived there in ancient times, but now it's known as a dungeon. A relevant record left by Sorcerer Michek is in the body of one of the Flame Bats guarding the dungeon. I have been there several times but the Bat is so strong I was unable to defeat it. Still, I think you can handle it. Go to the Battle Square, kill the Flame Bat and get Michek's Document from its body. You can get there using the Portal next to the east gate of the village. The place is very narrow so it will be hard for you to escape. You'd better go with a party and make sure you're well prepared.	Sorcerer Michek is nothing but a legend from an underground tribe. He once tried to get chaos under control but he was driven to another world during the battle. Anyway, go to Battle Square, kill the Flame Bat and retrieve Michek's Document. You can get there through the Portal next to the east gate.	You did a great job. This is Michek's Document, but I can't open the seal. On the surface... These are really sophisticated Elemental characters. I can barely read them... when the time comes... this will open. I don't get it. I'll have to give it some thought.

Take Michek's Document to Pharmacist Joaquin southwest of the city, and ask him.	You say you brought the Document? Let me see it. This is Sorcerer Michek's Document.

Perhaps you can do the hard work for me. I'll translate the document while you're at it. Oh, no. I'm not saying you should actually bring back the heart. An Earth Golem's Heart would turn to dust and blow away if you tried to remove it without the proper skills. What I need you to do is kill ten Earth Golems in Battle Square. Get there through the Portal next to the east gate. It's difficult to escape down the narrow passage, so I suggest you take the proper equipment and take a few friends to help you out.	This is urgent for both of us. I need Earth Golem's Heart and you need the Document. So go to Battle Square through the Portal next to the eastern gate and catch ten Earth Golems.	Thanks to you I got the Earth Golem Hearts I needed. Yes, I promised to tell you about the contents of the Document. Here's what I've learned so far.... Back when Battle Square was the castle of an underground tribe, the Square was under the control of Michek. However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek escaped from prison somehow and fought Basarah, who eventually left the castle and it became Battle Square. That's all for today. I have to take care of other things. Just wait.						758	Earth Golem	10																																1. Destroy ten Earth Golems in Battlesquare.	4	2.

He was there to the guard five heroes who followed Mikey. They were detained deep in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord. The rumor that there are people detained in the dungeon has been around for a long time. Maybe the rumor is true. I want to see this in person. Move to the Battle Square by using the Portal next to the east gate. And then, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I'll find out the whereabouts of the heroes. The place is so dangerous. So I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.	As he was chosen by Basarah to take care of the dungeon, Magmaron will have strong evil powers. Fortunately however, as he also has a weakness, so we can beat him. After moving to Battle Square through the Portal next to the east gate, defeat Magmaron in the middle of Battle Square. I will find out where the heroes are. The place is so dangerous. You'd better go only after putting together a party with others and making careful preparations.	You took down invincible Magmaron, but I can't find the five heroes. I've only found shackles as evidence they were there. I wonder where they've gone. Of course, as long as Basarah is alive, they probably won't show up. Only when Basarah has fallen will they see a peace. Anyhow, thank you for letting sunshine light the Battle Square.						760	Magmaron	1																																1. Defeat a Magmaron in Battlesquare.	4	2.

Once you enter, it won't be easy for you to escape, so I suggest you take the proper equipment and go with a few others to help you out.

However, he got into a disagreement with his colleague Rome, who ended up putting him in prison. Then Rome made the mistake of taking in Sorcerer Basarah to help him. Basarah quickly took over the castle and killed Rome. Michek petitioned Basarah for his freedom and eventually he was allowed to leave. Since then, the castle turned into the Battle Square.

Basarah left the land that was sought after by all tribes.  But Magmaron, his right-hand man, still remained.  It was his job to protect the five heroes, who followed Mikey, and who were imprisoned in the dungeon. The five heroes probably have something to do with the Archlord.

Well, you took down invincible Magmaron, but I failed to find the five heroes. I only found shackles as evidence that they were there. Those aren't exciting to paint. I'm very disappointed.

In fact, I was so happy I forgot to prepare thoroughly before starting my excavation. Deep underground I found a long hall called The Passageway of Death. By the time I realized where I was, I had already disturbed Neri, the consort to the Queen of the Dead! Legend says he was awake when he was sealed in the tomb with her anciently, swearing he would protect her forever. What a terrible, dark spirit he has become! I barely escaped and realized the only thing I could do was try to keep Neri from escaping while I wrote letters begging my friends to send me a hero who could help. Now I'm begging you. Please defeat Neri in the Passageway of Death and bring out his Sword. I can only hope the Queen of the Dead hasn't awakened too....	Reckles is in the Passageway of Death in the Asylum. Bring me the Sword of Reckles' after taking him down.	Ah, you made it! This is definitely Reckles's Sword. We finally managed to appease the dark spirit. There is only one thing left to do now.

We should take this opportunity to defeat Muertena, the Queen of the Dead herself! That sword was not just the source of his power but part of Muertena’s too ? now is the golden moment to strike! This battle will be tough, but please, go to the Audience Chamber and destroy Muertena, then bring me the last of her remains. Our long struggle will finally come to an end once we seal Muertena’s Tooth.	This will be the toughest battle, but if you trust your courage and ability, you will win.

Ancient history is supposed to be recorded on it, but I can't approach the statue because Karencha, a strong werewolf, is guarding it. Bring me the Stone Tablet and I will reward you fairly.	There'll be a Discarded Stone Tablet in the chamber Karencha is guarding. You don't need to risk taking him on, just get the tablet and be careful.	Oh, you found it. But, hmm...

There are so many missing words. I'm sorry but I have another favor to ask you. Of all the chambers here, there's one where the Queen Spider, Sevent, is building a nest. I'm sure I saw another stone tablet in there near a pillar. Since Sevent is there, I'm sure the tablet is already broken, but it should still be quite useful in interpreting this. If you get me the Broken Stone Tablet, I'll reward you generously.	There's a Broken Stone Tablet inside the pillar in the chamber Sevent is guarding. Cevent is a powerful monster, so don't take the risk of taking her down. Just get me the Broken Stone Tablet in the pillar. Be careful.	Hmm, my prediction was right.

She will be first in line in the parade for the coming Lemirable Saibanel Festival. That means she has to be with her Para Simpre. But Laruna said she would never take the ceremony of Para Simpre with a man weaker than her. Well, Firnelli may have lucked out, as he's so strong and does love my sister. Unfortunately, he's too shy. Anyway, I have to address this problem. First of all, we need weapons. He has to show he's not weak. For good weapons, we need good materials. So please find a Reinforcing Stone near the Abandoned Orchard and ask Blacksmith Ayre to build weapons with it. Once Firnelli shows his strength to my sister, it will surely work. Firnelli is quite a strong man, indeed. May the Elementals be with you!	Please! Find a Reinforcing Stone near the Abandoned Orchard and deliver it to Blacksmith Ayre. Please help. May the Elementals be with you!	Um, you need weapons for Firnelli? Will Firnelli go anywhere with the weapons? What? He will use the weapons to show off his strength in front of Laruna? Oh, that's good. I'll make weapons for him. As many as he wants. Wait for a while, please.																				191693343	2651	Reinforcing Stone	1																	1.

Laruna wants me, no, my money...oh, no, she is such a hot-tempered girl, anyway. It's a huge problem if I make her angry. It's a very...very difficult situation.

It's... I'm so sorry. I actually lost my magic book. Master's gonna be really mad if he finds out about this. What should I do? Where did I lose it? I was just taking a walk on the Path of Glory yesterday afternoon. I accidentally tripped and fell. I think that's when I lost it. But I didn't know that until I got home. And the thing is, I had a huge backlog of work needing to be taken care of, so I couldn't go back to find it. What? Why I didn't go searching for it instead of sending pigeons away? It's...just...um...it just wasn't easy. So, please find the Lost Magic Book on the Path of Glory for me, would you? Please. May the blessing of the Elementals be with you.	This is all my fault..

I misplaced it. Even though it's a Torn Magic Book, my magical power lies within it. It may be useful someday. I know it can't even get close to my master's though.

Oh, I didn't tell you that part. It's not a big deal. Siaforce just asked me to make him a Beginner's Magic Book so he can learn some spells. But I forgot a part of the beginner's spells, so I wasn't able to make the book. Haha, my master would be really angry if he knew about this.

I tried to read the future this morning. And guess what? I ended up seeing one of the worst omens in my life. Since then I've been so depressed and it's getting worse. What did the omens say? You know the northern part of Laflesia is haunted by young Direwolves, right? The omens said they might hurt my guild customers. You can imagine how I felt about that. It's really so awful. Usually, however, the answer to these kinds of problems is pretty simple. Drive the monsters out of there and bad things won't happen. Don't you think? So I need you to defeat twelve Young Direwolves at Ariel. I haven't felt this bad in a while.

So I did a little research about the monsters in the neighborhood and got some information. Bandillions north of Laflesia started moving in gradually. I'm trying to get more detailed information about the Bandillions, but it's not easy to go undercover whilst among them. So, I need you to distract them a little.

However, I think they are bold enough to go ahead with their original plans even without the written plans in hand. They wouldn't care about such small things. So, we need to find the plan and get the information. Fortunately, I know where I lost it. Find the Bandillion's Plan at Ariel and give it to Kariel who lives east of Laflesia.

A large amount of horse feed would mean they have many horses for their cavalry. It's simply too dangerous to let them build an army of any size. We're supposed to ask Kiprosos for his opinion first, but we can't afford to wait. They get the feed today. I need you to first defeat Veteran Jung of Bandillion south of Rualala and bring me the Horsefeed. You can just bring it to me even if there isn't much. With the feed, I can determine the size of their existing cavalry and its type. So, get going.	If we have the knowledge of what type of cavalry they are building and how large it is, it will be much easier to fight back. So, I need something to estimate the figures.

The best quarry is west of Norine. So I traveled out there with my pick and out of nowhere, a group of Lamias attacked me. It wasn't that difficult to run them off, but my pick was broken in the process. That really makes me angry whenever I think about it. Seriously. So, I need you to meet with Sorcerer Neural at the center of Laflesia and ask him how to defeat all those Lamias.  May the hammer of the Elementals pave the way for you.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, Lamias have a very strict hierarchy. They distinguish their classes with smell. They may not really look distinctive, but Lamias are very sensitive to the scent of their own kind. Accordingly, we have an easier answer than we expected. Just make yourself smell like a strong Lamia. The problem is, I don't really know which one is strongest. For this, we need some tricks. I actually left a monster mark at a bridge near Rualala. The mark records information about monsters passing by. I need to look at the record and see which one was the strongest. I need you to bring me the Lamia's Mark from Rualala.

2078	Rodellite	Lincent's Prediction	Laflesia; Lincent	1		13				3	2077	Timorous Cariten	<Stylist> Lincent	<Stylist> Lincent				First of all, I have a question for you. You met Cariten before coming here, right? What do you think of him? You think he pretends to be active but is actually indecisive? Well, in a sense, you're right. He and I had the ceremony of Para Siempre. But that was just the ceremony. Other than that, nothing changed from before to after the ceremony. Pardon? Is Cariten's Para Siempre me? Why, you haven't heard of it? Well, that's just how he does everything. You want to know why he behaves like that? It's because of our families. Family unity is generally weak in the Moon Elf community, except for his and mine. Our families are still growling at each other over which one has the oldest history in Laflesia. Isn't it just stupid? I just don't understand why this is important. By the way, I guess I have to do this. Well, before telling you that, can you bring me some Red Divination Grass from Lunaway Swamp? I need the grass to accomplish what I'm trying to do, and I can disclose it to others only when it's completed. Please. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Please hurry to find the Red Divination Grass in the Lunaway Swamp. I don't want any more delays. May the protection of the Elementals always be with you.	So, it was there. Then the time is near. Good. In fact, the Red Divination Grass has dropped its Small Tentacles. And that means the most beautiful flower in Khantra, Rodellite is about to bloom. Want to give it a try?																				185140469	2666	Red Divination Grass	1																	1. Find Red Divination Grass in the Lunaway Swamp.	6	2.

I can't say for sure the Rodellite bloomed, but if not, it'll happen soon. Now, I need to see the Small Tentacles. First, I need you to defeat seven Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory. Then I'll check them myself. No matter how indecisive Cariten is, he will make up his mind when I give him Rodellite. Now, shall we defeat some Small Tentacles? May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Go at once. While you defeat seven Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory, I will do some research. There will be satisfying results for sure. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.	Well, that's a little disappointing. It might not be the right time yet. But it usually blooms around now? This is confusing.. I need some time to think.						479	Small Tentacle	7																																1.

It might be easier for you to go alone than to take a total novice like me with you. Ok. I'll just leave everything to you. Rodellite has many different meanings since it's so beautiful. For example, giving six Rodellites means I dedicate my passion and love to only you forever. And I'd like to say that to Cariten with this flower. It may give him a chance to break free from the family. To be honest with you, I wish he would give me Rodellites. But if I wait for that to happen, I won't receive the flowers until I return to the Elemental world. So please get six Rodellites from the Small Tentacles south of the Path of Glory and bring them to Safe Keeper Cariten in the north central part of Laflesia. I hope it will make him strong and resolute. May the protection of the kind Elementals always be with you.

A citizen named Dudain north of Laflesia wants to meet you. I'm only a messenger, and I have to tell you it might not be a good idea to get involved in her business. Dudain is one of the richest people in Laflesia and wants to have everything her way. She has quite a temper. In fact, I don't usually comply with her requests... no, orders. But I couldn't help it this time. However trivial her demands may be, please keep in mind it's not a good idea to get too involved in her business. May the blessings of the Elementals shine your glory in the future.	Please be careful. Find Dudain in Laflesia. May the blessings of the Elementals shine gloriously in your future.	Huh, so it was you. The adventurer with quite a name in Laflesia. You definitely look uglier than I thought and you have such a horrific sense of fashion. Well, what else can I expect from an adventurer? Anyway, you need to run an errand for me.																																								1.

Since then I've been so depressed and I feel terrible now. Why? Of course because it was expensive. Hey, listen. An adventurer like you could never even dream of buying something like that. Even I, with all my wealth, had some difficulties getting the pendant. What other explanation do you need? I simply don't want my pendant to belong to some morons who don't even know how valuable it is. Go to the Old Land and retrieve my Lost Pendant. Hurry. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals and me.	Why are you wasting time here? Go at once! How are you ever going to accomplish this task when you're so lazy? Move! Go and find my Lost Pendant in the Old Land. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals.	You got the right one. I was about to report to the city guards that you're a fraud. I guess it's unnecessary now. Ok, now that you brought me the pendant, you might be trustworthy. Anyway, this pendant is just a cheap immitation. I was just testing your reliability.																				185073775	2672	Lost Pendant	1																	1. Find the Lost Pendant in the Old Land.	6	2.

They really are bothering me these days. Those city guards are making so much noise running around at night trying to defeat those monsters or whatever, and I just can't sleep. I warned the city guards a number of times to be quiet, but their feeble excuse is always the Maryliths. When the monsters are gone, everything will be settled and quiet. You go right ahead and defeat fifteen Marylith Liquids. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals and me.	What's taking you so long? Go and do the work. I didn't hire you so I could just watch you idling around. Defeat those fifteen Marylith Liquids and then you can see me. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals.	Why are you so slow!? How can I have you work for me if you're this slow? Blimey! All adventurers are just too slow and useless. Alright, you finished the job at least.

It's a great opportunity to strengthen my position in Laflesia, so you need to do this right. Once it's finished, you can go on your own. It means you don't have to show your ugly face to me anymore. What's the job? Since when did you become someone who dares ask me questions? You just stay still until I tell you what to do. Now, there's a unique Marylith near Laflesia, called Arniel. It is strong and smart, so it's a headache to Laflesia. I know Kiprosos is also working hard to kill that wretched thing, but his efforts are in vain. If you can defeat Arniel west of the Karebun Road and take the Proof of Hunting to City Representative Kiprosos in the center of Laflesia under my name, he will finally realize his limits. Do you understand? If you do, then go. You'd better succeed in this. I will not forget your name if you make it. Otherwise, I'll make sure no one remembers your name ever. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals and me.	Stop wasting time. Go west of the Karebun Road and defeat Arniel. Take the Proof of Hunting to City Representative Kiprosos in Laflesia. Blessings to you in the name of the Elementals and me.	This is...Proof of Hunting. Why do you give this to me...? Dudain? Indeed. She still clings to the idea. I'm very satisfied that one of the troubles of Laflesia is gone. I don't know if she is content with that. Anyway, it's certain you solved another problem for us.

I was attacked by Death Eyeballs on my way back from a neighboring town after shopping. I would've driven them away, but I was ambushed. Anyway, half of what I bought was broken. It wasn't like this before, but these days the monsters make it really difficult to get supplies. Can you go north of the Karebun Road and defeat twelve of those darn Death Eyeballs? I'd come up with a reward for that. May the Elementals watch over you.	Those things are really hurting my business. Please defeat twelve Death Eyeballs north of the Karebun Road.

There are several family clans with lots of history in Laflesia. The oldest of all is my Glory of the West. We have always been in Laflesia and always will be. But these days there's trouble in our glorious family. I'm talking about my son, the black sheep. This rascal dares to date a daughter of the Radiance of the East clan. They're frivolous and lowly. They even shamelessly insist that their clan has the oldest history. I just can't let him go on like this. Please go and talk to my son Safe Keeper Cariten in the middle of the northern part  of Laflesia and tell him to wake up. If an outsider like you says this to him, he might come to his senses. May the Elementals watch over you.	Please go and talk to the Safe Keeper Cariten and tell him to wake up. He won't listen to me any longer. May the Elementals watch over you.	Father sent you here. Then you heard the story. Yes, it's true. Lincent and I had the Ceremony of Para Siempre. But my Glory of the West clan and her Radiance of the East have had a long and bitter feud. In fact, they have been together since the very early stages of Laflesia. But nowadays they fight over who has the longer history. But I don't care. I just want to be with her.

But using a rather shocking method might be effective in this case. In fact, Lincent and I both abandoned our clans' crests. We thought we would be able to at least partially make ourselves understood to the elders of the two clans and avoid interference but it turned out to be useless. Now all I can do is give back my crest. It means I choose to leave the clan and live on my own. If I do that, I can be independent from any type of clan influence. That's not the way Moon Elves usually live. I do want to be recognized by everyone. If not everyone, at least I want my family to recognize me but if that doesn't work...can you help me? You can first retrieve the Crest of the Clan from the Old Land. Please find it and bring it to me. May the blessings of the kind Elementals be with you.	Please bring me the Crest of the Clan from the Old Land. May the blessings of the kind Elementals be with you.	Glory..of the West. Yes. This is the crest of my clan. What a glorious crest.

Great, I would really appreciate it if you could! But I don't even know their names. Oh, you can go to Alchemist Robello just north of Laflesia. He should know what those monsters are.

These can terrify Ronendl better than any other creatures around here. Some may say they're cute, though, and I tend to agree. They're called Broken Avengers. These poor things came into the world because of insane alchemists. As an alchemist myself, I just can't forgive those who would make such a thing. Apart from disregarding the dignity of life, they created things they can't even be responsible for and now they frighten people. What a shame. I'll need to find out who made these.

I was about to send you a message, but apparently, it won't be necessary. Now, I want to tell you what this is about. The movement of monsters has abruptly stopped near the Road of Joy south of Deribelle and we have not seen any further movement, so either this is their destination or they are trying to distract us. It's really too early to tell. That does not mean we should sit on our hands and do nothing. I gave Archeologist Kiriscent full authority regarding this matter. She is northwest of Deribelle. Go find her and help her work. She is a brilliant lady, and as you might know, she is one of the candidates that may succeed me as elder. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!

First of all, the monsters are united enough to attack Deribelle right now, but they're not. There must be a reason. Without knowing it, we shouldn't draw any conclusions. Your mission is to find out the current status of the monsters. That sounds like an enormous job, but all you have to do is destroy monsters as usual. Kill ten Rock Torges and ten Vampire Bats in Lands End. Given the recent relations of monsters, such an attack will force them to do something. We will closely watch their reactions and find out what secrets they're hiding. I know they're not easy to deal with but I think we can trust you, the one Great Elder Aratama introduced to us. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the Elementals be with you!	Destroy ten Rock Torges and ten Vampire Bats at Lands End. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the Elementals be with you.	Welcome.

One of the scouts returned with a very interesting message. While you were destroying monsters, Hukarung, Chief of the Trolls, went berserk. He's more intelligent than other monsters, so it's possible he reacted in a stronger way. That seems to indicate a grand master is behind all this and I want to know who it is. We'll be able to find out more if we investigate the Proof of the Covenant the scouts had said Hukarung possesses. Destroy the Troll Chief Hukarung in the Hunter's Forest and bring back the Proof of the Covenant. Maybe the truth is even scarier than we think. Maybe all this is related to the darkness in Northern Land. I hope I'm all worked up about nothing but the truth will reveal itself soon.

But if innocent elves are hurt or even killed by monster attacks while we're distracted with this, our efforts will be for nothing. And monster attacks are occurring almost everywhere. Maybe that's why the Great Elder gave me this mission. Then I'll handle this my way. You, go to the gate, south of Glory Port immediately and defeat Bleezers, Boss of Blade Crows, and bring back the Proof of the Covenant he has.

This is not written in any book. This is folklore so you may not have heard it before. Long ago, the Moon Elf ancestors who founded Deribelle were expanding their territory northward, and they came across a powerful monster. This monster was beyond description. She had many monsters doing her bidding and she harassed and tormented the Moon Elves. Our ancestors gathered people with special powers to fight her. Their combat skills were minimal but they had this special power to permanently seal the target they wanted. In the end, with great sacrifice, she, the queen of monsters, the Queen of the Dead, was sealed away for eternity! That is where the Queen of the Dead is now located.  And now... she is trying to resurrect herself. This is very dangerous. Her power has escaped the seal and is manipulating other monsters! Please report this to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle. I have to do more research. May the ancient wisdom and soul of the spirits be with you!	It's now clear she's trying to break the seal! But surely, there's a way to stop her. I have to find out how. Go to the Great Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle and report this.

Argh, this is my worst nightmare! By now I might be the only one who can remember her. People who rose up against her died in vain before their time. Only a few, including myself, survived till now and If she is let loose again, we have no way to stop her. All we can do is buy more time while Kiriscent finds out ways to reinforce the seal. We should do what we have to do. First of all, fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar. If my memory serves me right, their job is to provide nutrition the Queen needs. May the guidance of the Elementals show you the light!	I don't know how much time is left for us, but we have to do our best! Fight off one hundred Canedog Combatants and two Wild Liches near the Blood Altar.

You just thought you'd drop by and see how I am? Well, unfortunately I can't answer 'I'm good.' In fact, I'm having some problems with the Canedog Combatants. Even the Karebun Road connecting Laflresia and Deribelle was once blocked, the road used to deliver Hasesana. Fortunately, the road is open again thanks to Bercelluna and the guards, but the Hasesana shipments have dropped by nearly half and some of my customers were hurt. Oh, it's just a huge mess. We Moon Elves love Hasesana. What's the use of living if we can't even taste and smell the sweet, sweet Hasesana juice? It's just terrible. Maybe that's why I'm so weary these days. If I could, I'd take revenge on the Canedog Combatants, but I can't because I'm so weak. Oh, it's so stressful. What? You'd like to help? Oh... Thank you so much. Defeat the Canedog Combatants near the Blood Altar and bring me five Combatant's Helmets as evidence. Maybe I'll get my revenge, thanks to you. May the determination and wisdom of the Elementals be with you.	Defeat the Canedog Combatants near the Blood Alter and bring me five Combatant's Helmets as evidence.

More than five hundred years ago, Deribelle was founded. Elder Aratama is the only person who has lived here all that time. Moon Elves live so long we rarely make history books, and that habit often gets us into trouble. In order to prevent such problems in the future, I'm writing various history books as an archeologist. Currently I'm working on the history of Deribelle. Of course, I'm also doing research on other important matters at the same time. One of them is the Queen of the Dead. Her legend and the creation of Deribelle date back to almost the same period.  Aratama said that too, but unfortunately, Aratama's memory isn't as good as it used to be. So I usually collect several items and do comparitive research like this. Oh, I'm sorry for rambling. Could you get me two Antidote Potions from Merchant Velven, just south of Deribelle? I need them to sterilize the Helmets. May the ancient knowledge and the spirit of the Elementals be with you!	Could you get me two Antidote Potions from Merchant Velven south of Deribelle?

Oh, I guess I haven't told you the reason, yet. Well, I think that Canedogs are simply followers of Gnolls. The reason can be found in the period when Canedogs first started to make their presence known around Deribelle.  Before the birth of Deribelle and Canedogs, only Gnolls used to live around here. So I figured out that finding the origin of Canedogs would help me interpret the history of Deribelle from a new perspective. That's why I am asking for your help. You think you sort of understand? Hahaha! Archeology is, by its nature, somewhat confusing and vague.  At one moment, you think you know something, but the next moment, you don't know anything at all. And when you gradually start unravelling each problem, you discover new answers and new problems. That's why archaeology is so attractive.

Recently, I was hunting near the region of the Queen of the Dead with some other hunters from the city when we were attacked by monsters. We managed to escape without any major injuries because Kiriscent and Berceluna had warned us before we left and we prepared accordingly. Howver, during the fighting, I lost my bow. Without it, I can't hunt. I'm sorry, but could you go find the Broken Bow in the region of the Queen of the Dead, southwest of Deribel? May you be blessed with the wisdom of the Elementals.

Whenever I go hunting, I keep an arrow at my side. Yes, it's quite uncomfortable, but there's a good reason for it. As you know, for a long time, we Moonelves used to have rituals before going hunting. Today, short, simple rituals have taken the place of the traditionally longer ones. Hunters also carry with them a special symbol of their own to prevent injuries and to pay honor to their game. My symbol is an arrow. I think hunting with an arrow by my side is a way of paying true respect to my sport. Well, that's the arrow I've lost. I can vaguely recall where I last had it, but as a hunter who has broken his bow and lost his symbol, I can't leave the city. My pride won't allow it. Can you look for the arrow for me? First, use this Houdian's Work Knife to search the rocks in the Spores of Joy, south of Deribelle. I'm sure my arrow will be stuck in one of the rocks.  Please.

Others may not be taking this seriously, but Berceluna is complaining already that it's hard to find good clothes these days. It's understandable, though since she frequently gets into fights with monsters and it's a nuisance to repair torn clothes every time.

There are ruins of an ancient people who lived there long before the Moon Elves. Of course, the place had a different name then, not a shocking one like Blood Altar. The original temple was built to praise the Elementals, but it was destroyed by the Queen of the Dead, along with all the ancient inhabitants. When Moon Elves began to live in Deribelle, the place changed. It was no longer a place to praise the Elementals but a fierce battleground where the Queen of the Dead and Moon Elves fought fiercely. The Queen slew so many elves their blood covered the altar. Since then the place has been called the Blood Altar and become a place of fear to Moon Elves. Even after the Queen was sealed away, elves still avoided that place. But not everybody is afraid. For a Halfling Sorcerer like me, it's a place for new knowledge rather than fear. Anyway, I talk too much. What I ask is not difficult. All you have to do is take this Amber Stone to Observer Elkain. He's protecting the Altar of Blood... What? Who is this Elkain? You will know when you get there. Now take this and off you go!	All you have to do is take this Amber Stone to Observer Elkain, who is protecting the Blood Altar.	Welcome, hero.

So I asked Sorcerer Excador to find some Amber Stone. Amber Stone is like the heart of Lairien and is a fitting tribute to his last moment. The one who successfully completes the quest by bringing the stone is worthy of witnessing the end of Lairien. Yes, you're right. It was Lairien who pointed you out and who needed Amber Stone. Now, move closer to Lairien. Give the Amber Stone to Lairien, protector of the Blood Altar. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!

Will you lend a helping hand to this place which has lost the power of the Elementals? You see long before the Moon Elves arrived in Chantra, people lived here who filled this place with the pure power of the Elementals. They would be shocked to see how monsters are now defiling their cherished ground but I think something even more sinister is at work now. The energy of young the Moon Elf warriors who sacrificed themselves to seal the Queen of the Dead remains here as well, and I think these monsters were sent here by more powerful monsters, to prevent the Elementals from purifying this place once again. That would be a tragic loss. Without the energy of the Elementals and our Ancestors, this place is nothing but old ruins. So I want to ask a favor of you.

In my shock and panic, I threw at them whatever I had in my hands and made an escape. It was lucky I got away, but sadly my research paper was among the stuff I threw at the monsters. Thank goodness the book itself was safe as it was caught by other luggage, but a few pages were torn away from the most important part of the book. So please...

Oh, you're looking for... a job? Hmm... actually there is one thing. You know the creatures called Green Poison Moths? Yes, right. As a matter of fact, an object was delivered to me from the Elf village a few days ago. As usual I left Deribel for a short while to remove the curse on the object, but Green Poison Moths attacked me to try to steal the object. I think the energy of the curse I was removing drew them in. Whatever the reason may be, I failed to lift the curse. So I want to leave Deribelle again today to try one more time, but the moths are sure to attack me again. Of course it's no use if the same thing keeps happening. So can you go to the Spores of Joy and dispose of ten Green Poison Moths? While you deal with them, I'll remove the curse and return to Deribel.

This is not much of a reward, but I want to tell you a story. You may have heard some of this before, but long ago this place was a fierce battleground between Moon Elves and the Queen of the Dead. Here, Moon Elves collected the energy of the Elementals to seal the Queen and this is where the Queen sent massive forces to prevent it. Blood flowed at this place for ten days and nights. The Queen's forces succeeded in destroying the Moon Elf Guards, but the Elves completed the seal at the last moment. So in the end, both sides were devastated. Unfortunately one warrior of the Queen's forces survived. Her name is Queen Firianes... She disappeared after the battle and nobody has seen her since. But recently I've had this ominous feeling. I think she has returned, though I don't know where she is. Aratama was the only Moon Elf to survive the battle with the Queen. He may have some insight on how to find her. So young hero, please hurry to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle, and convey my concerns. May the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Go immediately to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle, and tell him this story. Please, young hero, may the guidance of the Elementals light the hero's path!	Welcome, young traveler.

But we still don't know where she is, so we have to proceed carefully, one step at a time. Yes. Then first, young hero, bring me ten Wolves' Hides from the Young Dreadwolves in the Spores of Joy.

To us Moon Elves, she was better known as the Assassin of Despair... I found out where she is now. I think the devil is north of the region of the Queen of Lion. It seems she's being drawn to the increasing energy of the Queen. Don't underestimate Firianes' power... her cleverness.. During the battle at the Blood Altar between Moon Elves and monsters led by Firianes, we were slaughtered. Countless Elves died at her hand. It was a miracle from the Elementals that we completed the seal under those circumstances. Firianes' power... it's beyond words. And now the Assassin has reappeared. Still, we may be able to destroy her if we act quickly. The energy from the Queen of the Dead is still impaired for now. So I want to ask you. I know this is hard, but can you destroy Queen Firianes in the region of the Queen of Lion and take her Necklace to Elder Sharin Hyren at the center of Tor Fortress?

She said to get Spriggans' Daggers. I could do it myself but I have to leave immediately to collect information. Can you do it for me? In return, I'll tell you a bit of an old story. Listen carefully. You know the Spores of Joy Zone? That place used to be a huge Hasesana garden. The Hasesana grown there was excellent. Even Centaurs like me loved it. But one day a massive attack by a monster and her forces destroyed the garden. What was the monster's name? The Queen of the Dead, I think. Ever since, the monsters dominated that area and the land became barren. Recently, Great Elder Aratama built a barrier to stop the spore zone from expanding further, although it seems to me there's not much we can do to stop it. Anyway, that's the story. What do you think? Isn't it interesting? Well, well, you should get on with your work.

Now that Queen Firianes has been dealt with, we're waging a fierce battle with the thieves called Spriggans and we're in need of strong warriors. We just received a new message about it.

Storm Road? Well, a long time ago, thunder and lightning used to hit Storm Road almost constantly. It has abated somewhat nowadays, but instead the angry voices of monsters fill the place. So really, nothing much has really changed, heh. Of course, no one can deny Storm Road was a much more elegant place in the past. The ultimate purpose of the monsters swarming Storm Road nowadays is to get rid of us Moon Elves. It's because we sealed the Queen of the Dead. But their evil purpose doesn't mean we should lay down our lives without putting up a good fight. Still, we can't risk even a single life in vain. That's why we need more information. Of course, if we send out our scouts carelessly, they're sure to encounter Spriggans. What we need now is something to distract the Spriggans' attention. Yes? Are you suggesting you will be a decoy? ... It's a great idea but also very dangerous. What? You say we should trust the hero? Indeed, you are the hero of Deribelle. We will trust you.

This can be done by blocking Deadline and the Nightmare Valley. Does it sound impossible? Well, the Spriggans have never been so united, so it may happen. That means the only thing for us to do now is destroy their center. Yes. That's it. So I want to ask this of you.

This red line is the Spriggan's final defensive line which we secured after we repelled them the last time. As you can see, we forced them to retreat quite far from here thanks to you. The problem is this blue line. This is where Spriggan Chasers and Warriors are waging a fight. You see, the battle zone isn't fixed and spreads over a quite large area. In other words, they're not attacking us in groups but making small surprise attacks on strategic places, giving us a lot of trouble. Without disposing of them, we can't ensure peace in Tor Fortress. That's why I looked for you. It's very hard to find somebody who isn't widely known to Spriggans but has enough ability to fight them off. What you should do now is repel the Spriggan Chasers in the region of the Queen of the Dead and bring back the Chaser's Gloves. Of course I wouldn't send you alone. To fight a small group of enemies, you'll need some of my best soldiers. All you have to do is your part, nothing more. I know this is difficult but can you do this?

Fortunately, they retreated when our guards arrived suddenly, but as it turns out, the guards couldn't figure out where they retreated to. Now it looks like they're regrouping and planning to come back again. We can't let that happen, can we? So what you have to do is destroy twelve Spriggan Combatants in the Valley of Curses.

It dates back to the last battle with the Queen of the Dead. You might have heard about it. Since the queen was sealed with the blood of Moonelves, the fortress didn't become a battleground, even though it was built for that purpose. Ironically, the fortress became very useful in another way. It served as the first barrier to ward off the attacks of Humans. Nowadays we're on good terms with them but in the past, their reckless expansion caused some clashes with us Moon Elves. Every time, this fortress acted as the first barrier to ward Humans off. Interesting, eh? So, have you met Bolanmar? If you're looking for work, pay him a visit. He's looking for somebody to help him. Go to Alchemist Bolanmar south of Tor Fortress.

The entrance to the prison was named Nightmare Valley and the escape route, which only a lucky few got to use, was named the Valley of Screams as the screams of remaining criminals echoed the whole way down. Nowadays, it's no longer a prison. Spriggans are all over it, and the Spriggans' Proof of the Covenant is also there. If... if we can get that.... Please.

I guess we're just kindred spirits as they say. So let me give you some advice. This lonely village is located in the middle of the desert and there's nothing surrounding it, so we're vulnerable from all directions. There are lots of thieves targeting merchants traveling here, so lone travelers like you tend to draw the wrong kind of attention. If you lose favor with the village chief, your life may suddenly become very difficult. This is a Letter of Introduction among us Kobolts. If you go North East of the Village and show it to Headman Yon, he'll trust you.	Don't think you can do everything for yourself. So show this Letter of Introduction to Headman Yon northeast of the village.	My, my. Is Toray playing a trick again? Ah, it may be an overstatement to call it a trick. When Toray meets adventurers he likes, he gives them his own letter of introduction. At least the letter shows he trusts you, but what he said is true. This village is so isolated we can't welcome just any traveler. We select them with a thorough procedure.

You give me the impression you're not an ordinary person. Maybe he felt it too, but that's a personal opinion, and I need objective judgment on this. I'll give you a mission and judge you according to the results. If you go south outside the village, there are monsters called Gray Dingos. They harass travelers coming to this village.

It's hard to find that kind of stimulant these days, but the sorcerer said we can get some from the Cave Wings in Cave Town.

The songs and images were both superb, but most intriguing is the magic spell. They say Gallitos hid a powerful spell among the passages of the story, but nobody has ever found it.

At times like this, a little magic wouldn't hurt. Come closer, will you? What I wrote on your forehead is a chasing spell. I wrote the spell with the ashes of a page from the first book of the Gallitos Series. Now if you cast a simple spell, the power of this book will draw you to the other volume. I'll teach you the spell. Ahh, but it is of no use to cast the spell now. You're in the wrong location. You have to cast the spell in the place you found the first book. But before that, get forty Wolves' Furs. You can get them using your Ransacking skill on the Gray Dingos in the Debris of the Muted Site. Cast the spell I taught you while spreading the Furs over the Debris. Go and bring back good news!	Don't you believe me? I'm a sorcerer! Get forty Wolf Furs.

It's been pretty quiet for a while since the road between Windrill and Silancium was blocked. Not many outsiders visited here. But then the number of travelers searching for the Archons started rising fast and now there are a number of big and small accidents happening. If this situation continues, the people in the village might not get along with each other any more. One of the travelers told me some small villages have their own festivals, and through these festivals the people of the villages are brought together. I think it's a brilliant idea. We haven't had this kind of festival before, so people are unfamiliar with the idea. I need to promote it and I need some help. It would be best to visit the people in the village one by one... Let's start with Toray. Recently, he tried to search the cave at Cave Town, but he had some trouble because of the Cave Wings. I think he would be very pleased if you hunt them for him. Destroy say... thirty-five of them. Then go to Grave Robber Toray north of the village and earn some credit with him.	Please destroy thirty-five Cave Wings in Cave Town. Then go to Grave Robber Toray north of the village and talk to him about the village festival.	Oh, you're the one who defeated the Cave Wings! I was able to escape thanks to you.

Are trying to persuade others to join in? Hmm... Then I'll help you out with some information. Blacksmith Nob recently lost a valuable Portable Anvil and has been very depressed ever since. So if you find it for him, I'm sure he'll join this festival of yours. Where did he say he lost it? Ah.. yes. He said it was in Cavetown. Maybe you can find it among the rocks. If you do, don't forget to bring it to Blacksmith Nob Sandwing east of the village.	This method will work. I guarantee you. Find the Portable Anvil among the rocks at Cave Town. Then give it to Blacksmith Nob east of the village. He'll be so pleased, he'll cooperate.	Isn't that my Portable Anvil? Where did you find it? Oh yes, of course it was there. Memory really is the first thing to go, I guess. Anyway, thank you. How can I repay you? Hmm... a Village festival... Yes, I'll join.

Spice Merchant Barios will be difficult though. He's very selfish, but if you find something he lost, he'll be very grateful. He'll do almost anything. Trancorpse Guilties recently robbed Barios of forty Boxes of Spice. If you get the boxes back, he'll cooperate with the village festival. Take the boxes to Spice Merchant Barios west of the village.	Don't worry, all will be well if you take Merchant Barios the forty Boxes of Spice of the South he lost. Get them from the Trancorpse Guilties in the Muted Site.	Huh? You! Those are my spices! Did you steal them? ... Hmm. I'm sorry if I called you a thief all of a sudden. The mood around here is so tense these days... What? They're having a village festival because of that? Tsk tsk...

What? Two? Well, I can tell you with confidence to give up on Sorcerer Roin. He doesn't think himself as a part of this village. He's always grumbling about living in a Kobold village. So you'd better go to Merchant Ferr. He's very cooperative and wouldn't mind whatever we do, but if he finds out about the festival later, he might feel bad thinking he was left out. Give him a token of our sincerity. Thirty Bandillion's Skins will be more than enough. The skins are from Syllancium, not Windrill, so they're somewhat valuable. You can get them by using your Skinning skills on the Duriven Fallens at the Windrill Eastern Entrance. When you're finished, take them to Merchant Ferr west of the Village.	Take 30 Bandillion's Skins to Merchant Ferr west of the village. You can use your Skinning skills on the Duriven Fallens at the eastern mouth of Windrill. That will work!	Hmm, I don't particularly need Bandillion's Skins. I have tons of them in my warehouse. But I heard there's going to be a village festival and you're promoting it.

He paid the ultimate price for wealth he thought he could get easily. On your way here you may have seen places named the Jewel Land and Cave town. People in Cave own were once miners, but not all the jewels they found in the caves were up to their high standards, so they discarded the inferior stones in the Jewel Land. Legend says the ground there used to be covered with precious gems. My brother went there to find some jewels, but he was too focused on wealth and not on his own personal safety. He was eaten by monsters. He brought this fate on himself, but I still want to hold a service in his memory. So if you destroy forty Adult Hawkarrows in Jewel Land I can search for his remains.

When Yaran was alive, it ate a whole lot of travelers whole, so after it died, many treasures were found in its body. But there are several significant objects yet to be found. The most famous one is Chester's Helmet. The helmet belonged to a well-known knight named Chester. It's one of the Moon Elves' things and has a strong resistance to the magic of the Elementals. Recently, a member of the Moon Elf nobility asked me to find it. In order to do that, I'll need to attach the Search Talisman to a tree in Yaran. Can you do that for me? I'll reward you.

It used to cause so much trouble in Windrill until a Moon Elf named Gracia defeated it. You might have heard the name before? You know, the road to Syllancium used to be blocked, barricaded as a desperate measure to stop Yaaran from escaping to other lands. That was just fifty years ago. The dragon was so huge, Gracia sealed the four legs first and told us to make sure the seals are intact all the time. If the seals are broken, Yaaran may absorb the evil energy into its bones and transform itself into an even stronger monster. We checked the seals regularly, but there's never been a problem, they were still holding well. Recently my servant told me one of the seals was damaged. If that is true, we should repair it immediately. Check the Kataria bound to the tree near the left bridge of Yaaran and if it really has been damaged, bring it back to me as soon as you can.	We should act immediately. Three seals are still intact. Check the Kataria bound to the tree near the left bridge of Yaaran and if it really has been damaged, bring it back to me as soon as you can.

The ones commonly sold can't replace the seal. We can't find Gracia, so we have to ask other Moon Elves. Since this is a grave matter, we should consult Elder Aratama, southeast of Deribelle in Vigoror, land of Moon Elves. I'll send a carrier pigeon ahead of you, and you should collect some gifts for him on the way. Something rare in Vigoror... thirty Gorgon's Skins would do nicely. You can use your Skinning skill on the Young Minotaurs to get them. Then give them to Aratama and tell him the current situation.	Give thirty Gorgon's Skins to Elder Aratama southeast of Deribelle in Vigoror. You can get the skins from the Young Minotaurs using your Skinning skill.	I already received the letter from the headman of Hideback. Gracia wasn't exactly welcomed among the Moon Elves. She took a strange route coming south, and she hid the Archon and didn't share it with other elves. In addition to that, she ruined our underground city for her own purposes. But I heard she destroyed Yaran in Windrill. So I know about the Kataria he used. That's a very valuable object even in the world of us Moon Elves, so It will be difficult to give it to Kobolts.

I'm from Tabuto Village, the village of the Balcksmiths. About fifty years, all the greatest Blacksmiths in the village worked together to create the best sword on the continent. We named it 'Barracuda' and it was a truly spectacular weapon. Unfortunately, behind our backs one of the Blacksmiths infused the sword with his evil will. As soon as it was finished, the Evil Sword devastated the village, then disappeared. We were never sure where the Sword went, but we think it crossed the lake. Ever since the dark power came from Northernland, rumors of evil have been all around, and we're worried our sword will be involved. We've decided to make a weapon to destroy Barracuda. To succeed, we need Irulda's Hammer. My collegues were bringing it here, but monsters killed all of them and stole the hammer.

Maggot Bullants are messing around with the other Staff. No, I didn't find this out through the records of Tabuto Village, but accidently. That isn't important, is it? Retrieving the Staff is what's important. So, I'd like you to destroy the Maggot Bullants at the Bullant Hatchery and bring back the Staff of Comfort.	If monsters destroy the Staff, it would betray the dead of Trilgard. Destroy the Maggot Bullants at the Bullant Hatchery and bring back the Staff of Comfort.	Good job. Now we have two Staffs.

But hunting Bullant's Eggs is against the Law of the Elementals, so we limit the number of Bullant Eggs all Merchants can sell every year, including me. But demand is growing, and now some people are using the blackmarket. I understand Spice Merchant Barios of this village is involved. According to the information collected by my servants, he secretly hid three Bullant's Eggs inside the village. He's intending to bargain with other merchants, but this can't be allowed. First of all, it puts the village in danger. The Bullants react quite violently when their eggs are stolen, and the mother Bullant searches all over, tracing the smell of the egg. So Bullants could attack this village any time now. This is an urgent quest, and I'd like you to help us. Retrieve the three Bullant' Eggs Barios hid at three Watchtowers, one at each Watchtower.	Let's get it over with quickly before Barios notices this quest. There's nothing confusing about the Watchtowers. Retrieve three Bullant's Eggs at three Watchtowers inside the village!	You brought them. Good! Ha Ha! I wonder if Barios got very upset.

I don't have any intention of doing it myself, but I'll ask my men to do it. Of course, since the Bullant's Eggs have a peculiar smell, the Bullants will notice them the moment my men step into the Bullant Hatchery. Then my men will be killed. This doesn't really work for me. So it will be best to shield the eggs with another animal's hide to block the smell while we put the eggs back safely all the way inside the Bullant Hatchery. Bring me an item to block the Bullant Egg's smell. Thirty-five Wolf's Hides will be enough. We don't have any in stock at the warehouse, so please get them for me by using your Skinning skills on the Grey Dingoes appearing the Border Area between Life and Death.	Even now the Bullant's Eggs are beginning to smell. You need to hurry. Destroy the Grey Dingoes on the Boundary of Life and get thirty-five Wolf Hides by using your Skinning skills on them.

Please destroy thirty Pharaoh Slaves at the Bullant Hatchery.	Though a bit wounded, my man managed to survive. Someone innocent has suffered because of foolish Barios.

Of course, the only hope for this task is Clairvoyance Magic. Deribel Sorcerer Excador has a Clairvoyance Spell Book I could use. I sent him a letter and he replied that he's happy to lend me the book, but asked me bring him something he needs for his magic experiments. He asked for thirty-five Eyes of the Sea.

It's the very place where Nathan and Walcure fought each other, and where Broomhart reappeared. Many people say the desert got its name because it was made within a decade due to the drastic desertification of Windrill. Well, it's very easy to get lost there, as the desert is vast. The region near Meteora is even called the Lost Direction Road, so many people get lost there. So we have put the Gleaming Flag on the rock gate at the entrance of the Desert so Travelers can find their way here even in the dark. While the flag is there, the travelers can keep their bearings and find their way out of the desert, but every time there's a sandstorm, the flag blows away, and the flag we hung a few months ago is gone now. So I'd like to ask you a favor. I'll give you this new Gleaming Flag. Hang it on the rock gate east of the Giant's Highroad.

Still, I received an order to carry out the work of the Elementals. It may have been worded as a polite request, but it was actually an order. Ellore Judge Farianelle told me he heard a rumor that the Queasa Guides north of Meteora had Dark Sentio's Talisman, which is a pagan item, on them. He ordered me to collect thirty-five of them. How can I reject the order of a judge? But I'm so busy at the moment, I don't have time. So I'd like to ask you a favor. It's a job for the Elementals. You will do it for me? Yes, I thought so.

To solve this problem, I need the help of a traveler like you who can keep a neutral position. Will you help me? Thank you. Let me tell you about the incident. A few days ago, an Orc Nobleman was found dead in the desert. He died from an arrow wound. One of the nobleman's men is furious and shifting the responsibility of finding the murderer onto us. He says if we don't succeed soon, Orcs will devastate this village. What a predicament! Looking at the circumstances, there are three possible suspects. We're working to verify the alibi each one gave us. We can sort out the truth with magic, but we need some evidence to start with. The prime suspect, Emtra, says he was alone hunting Walker Bullants by the Giant's Highroad when the incident happened. The proof he offers is the forty-five Arrows he left in the monsters. We need someone to retrieve all those Arrows. Will you do it? Great!	Destroy Walker Bullants by the Giant's Highroad and retrieve forty-five Arrows.	Good job.

Most of all, the traveler wouldn't have such terrific archery skills.......  Well, now we are down to the last suspect. This person is under much suspicion because Spice Merchant Barios confirms his alibi. But based on my experience over the years, I can't always believe Barios' testimony. He's easily swayed by his interests, and his eyes show he's concealing something. Let's make him tell the truth by offering him something he can't refuse. Barios wants something called the Giant's Spice. They used to be found in great numbers at the Giant's Highroad, but now they've become rare. I know where one of them is hidden. You'll be able to find the Giant's Spice if you look in the cracks of the rocks south of the Giant's Highroad. Deliver it to Spice Merchant Barios, just west of the village, and ask him about his testimony. Give up if he seems to be giving false testimony just because of the Giant's Spice. What we want from him is truth!	If we put in more effort, we'll get closer to the truth. Find the Spice of Giant in the cracks of the rocks south of the Giant's Highroad and deliver it to Spice Merchant Barios west of the village. Then receive a definite answer about his testimony from him.	The headman must have sent you to hear about the death of the Orc Nobleman. I swear on my ancestors' tomb, I did not tell a lie. He was with me. Oh, isn't that Spice of Giant? Can you sell that to me? You can give it to me if I tell the truth? But...but... Okay, give it to me first.

Long ago a giant meteor hit there. Some say the impact contributed to Windrill turning into a desert. I don't know if that's true, but I know a different legend certainly is. If you dig in Meteora, you can find something called Meteor Crystal. Sorcerers value it more than gold, but it's difficult to collect. The crystal disintegrates if it touches iron or steel, so you can't use a normal shovel. Sorcerer Roin has asked me to make him a special tool for getting Meteor Crystal. Naturally we'll need some unusual materials for this tool. Please go to Mine Mystic Eye at the Old Mine, West of the Verark Basin. He can give you the ore we need. It's called Tetramite.	It may be a long distance, but it should be easy for a competent person like you. Meet Miner Mine Mystic Eye at the Old Mine in Ezerock and bring back the Tetramite River!	Tetramite Ore?

When he received his order, he picked on things that didn't make sense about the items I made, and confiscated all my monthly income. A nobleman doing such a thing! Well, without that money, we'll be living in poverty for a long time. So I want you to go and get the money. No, I'm not asking you to steal it, just take back the money I've been robbed of!

The incident when Tetramite Ingots were lost in mass numbers while moving them to the other side of the continent. You might not know about the incident. Oh, right, you can get Tetramite by using this method. Rust Stormers stole the cargo. I don't know if you're aware, but those monsters eat metal. That's the way they supplement their bodies as they're attacked by the sand storms of the desert. So perhaps the Tetramite might be inside their stomachs. If that's not the case, there is no way to get Tetramite for now. We don't have any Tetramite Ore. So there is only one way for you to get the Tetramite. It was West of Orsilian that we were robbed of the Tetramite. Destroy the Rust Stomers there and retrieve thirty-five Tetramites with all that you've got, unless the monsters absorbed all of them into their body.

3428	Family Sword	Rumors about the Relic	Hideback; Ferr	1		67							<Merchant> Ferr	<Grave Robber> Toray				If you go to the Ten Year Desert, there's a place called Village of the Shadows. Humans established it long ago in times of conflict. On the outside, it looks like a place where bandits live, but in fact it's an outpost to observe the Orcs. When Ugdrasil raised his army, he of course didn't leave the place intact. The legend goes that after half a day of battle, all Humans guarding the village died, but the Leader Lan Sand displayed bravery until the very end. So Ugdrasil highly praised his valor and buried Lan Sand's Sword under the earth of Village of the Shadows to protect the land even after his death. Recently, a descendant of Lan Sand asked me to find the sword. I don't like to get involved in this kind of work, but I think the descendant's request is justifiable. So I said yes, but I'm not used to such work. Grave Robber Toray, north of this village, knows much about the relics near the village. Give him a Gorgon Metamorphosis Potion and get information.

I'm sure it's proper for the descendants of the Sand Family to want the sword, but I don't think it belongs to anyone anymore. It's been a servant of petty wars for so long, it deserves a respectable rest, so I decided to commit this Sword to the Elementals, giving up the great fortune I could have made by selling it. I need you to help me. If you go South East of the Village you can find one peculiar-looking rock sticking out there. You can commit the Sword to the Elementals through that rock. Please do as I ask!	Offer the Sand Family's Sword on the rock at Giants Highroad. There must be a reply from the Elementals.	I put the Sword on the rock and took a step back.

He's called the Illusion Monster because he's never been seen. In fact, it's wrong to call him a monster at all. Louis never harms anyone, he just plays practical jokes. But a new monster hunter has come to the village and says he's going to destroy Louis. I don't know why, but the hunter seems to believe Louis killed his friends. This is crazy. It was probably the Pharaoh Knights. Louis is good at hiding himself, so this hunt could drag on and on if we don't change the hunter's mind. If you give him his colleagues' rings, the misunderstanding may be resolved. Go destroy the Pharaoh Knights north of the Giant's Highroad and bring back 45 Rings of the Monster Hunters.	If the hunter gets the rings, he'll realize that Louis did not eat his colleagues. Destroy the Pharaoh Knights north of the Giant's Highroad and bring back forty-five Rings of the Monster Hunters.

I think we need to move him to Orsilian. We could lure him using bait. Louis likes Euriale's Talons. Prepare about thirty-five Talons, and lay out them on the rocks west of Orsilian. He'll immediately notice the smell and head that way. Isn't it odd that someone likes Talons? That is why I said Louis is obviously not harmful.	We don't have much time, so let's hurry. Prepare thirty-five Euriale's Talons and put them on the rocks west of Oacillian.	The whole thing sounds highly suspicious, but the headman wouldn't talk nonsense.

Out of sympathy, I sent Gold instead. I've done it for such a long time he must be waiting for the Gold. But travelers like you are really the ones who put the Gold into his hands. It's true, you're unwitting accomplices. Still, you should prepare 10,000 Gold and give it to Monster Master Ayorg in the Eternal Kingdom.	Prepare 10,000 Gold yourself and give it to Monster Master Georg in the Eternal Empire.	How did it go? Did it fail again this time? That cunning... Did you come back empty-handed? Don't you have anything to give me? That's right, you should give me the Gold. I actually don't know why I'm accepting this, but if you give it to me, I'll take it. Haha. What's good is good.

So if you are confident, defeat the Pharaoh King and go back to Merchant Ferr west of Hideback. Go ahead, leave. Haha. It will be impossible.	You're back safe! Thanks to you, my Merchants were saved, but I was wondering what happened to you. He is indeed as crazy a man as the rumors say. He was once a big time Merchant, even greater than I.

But he can't handle all the ordinary travelers rushing in on the city, so Giddem came up with a plan. He sent a limited number of Letters of Invitation to the chief of each village, and asked the chiefs to give the Letters of Invitation to people that they thought were outstanding. In fact, I have a Letter of Invitation, and I think you're great. So I'm thinking about sending you to Terranoa. How does that sound to you? You do want to go there? Then take this Letter of Invitation to Captain Giddem at the center of Terranoa.	He's also looking for outstanding talent, so he'll be happy to see you.

We have to bring in supplies from outside, just to survive. It's considered a sin in this city to waste even one piece of grain. A short while ago, a citizen returning from Hideback with a Grain Box lost his way in Meteora and left the Grain Box somewhere. He remembers he left it beside a rock, but when he went back, he couldn't find the rock. As he was not used to traveling, it might have been difficult for him, but a traveler like you can find it, can't you? Okay, it makes me happy to see you're willing to take on the task.

My friend Bundle is just a safe keeper, and Icigo has been running him into the ground, making him look bad for not contributing as much. So I've decided to annoy Icigo to help my friend. Will you help me? Yes, I see you already realize I always do the right thing! What I need is fifty Gargoyle's Skins. With them, I can attract monsters along the road where Icigo's supplies come in. You can get them easily by using your Skinning skills on the Gothicas near Giants Highroad.	If you drag things out, Icigo's supplies will arrive in the city.

I did also hear that you solved Icigo's problems. You cured the wounds he got because you did the wrong thing in the first place. In the future, try to do something right. Do things for the city as a whole instead of just one person. An example? Well, one thing comes to mind. There's a Black Vulture living in the hollow branch of a tree in Wuthering. He comes into the city, picks up anything shiny enough to catch his attention and takes it back to his nest in the tree. Not long ago, he took the city flag. True, it's just some fabric, but also represents the reputation of Terranoa. You could retrieve that flag.	Good things don't always have to be complicated. Find the Flag inside the tree branch at Wuthering.	Fights for power or dominance are not what Terranoa wants to see.

I don't think you're a spy for the captain, so I'll tell you. When the merchants settled in this city, the captain didn't allow any blacksmiths. He was worried their fires would destroy the deck or even the whole ship, which is understandable. I finally persuaded him at least one blacksmith was necessary, or no one would come to the city. He finally agreed to let me in, on the condition that I never harm the ship in any way, and if some accident happens, I have to leave immediately. Well, yesterday my assistant dropped a hot steel bar which scarred the deck. I need to repair it before the captain finds out, but the wood used for this deck is quite rare. I asked Grando to help because she stays on land, but it seems she's having a hard time finding it. So I was looking for someone else to pitch in, and that's when you showed up. Thank you.

The thing's too heavy and bulky to sneak it out, and nobody can take on the entire village of Ogres. So I propose you lure the Ogres out of the village. We don't have time to come up with a complicated plan, but I hope you can help us. Thirty-five slabs of Wolf Meat will be enough to draw the Ogres out of the Village.

In Ogre Village, there are four Small Skull Towers besides the Bone Tower at the center. Ogres hang up the skulls of the victims that they've eaten. The skulls are very important to them. According to my man, if you run away with a skull, all the Ogres will chase you. But the problem is, I have no man brave enough to step up and do that. Judging by the circumstances, only you can do it. Please. Steal four Talking Skulls from the four Small Skull Towers inside the Ogre Village.	You could fall prey to the Ogres, so be careful. Steal the four Talking Skulls from the four Small Skull Towers inside the Ogre Village, and quickly run away!	You're excellent. If you come to our country, you'll become a high-ranking official.

Hmm, the Ogres seemed to chase it a bit, but soon they just hung other Skulls there as if nothing had happened. I feel like we're being teased by those stupid Ogres! But if we do nothing, then we'll really feel stupid, so I'd like to try another proposal made by one of my men. Ogres are on bad terms with the monsters nearby, but they cooperate with Rock Stormers a bit. There's just one reason behind the cooperation. Ogres can't eat Rock Stormers. So, if we attack the Rock Stormers, wouldn't Ogres come help? Although it seems like a foolish plan, we have no other choice. Destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	At this point, I'll try anything! It's that precious. Go destroy forty Rock Stormers west of the Land of Loss.	Frankly speaking, I didn't expect much, and indeed it was pointless.

One of them is getting to know the most basic residents in this continent. These are residents that all travelers get to meet frequently. I'll introduce you to a merchant.

I'm quite disappointed that the extent of its real value is being downgraded as everyone's learning it these days. Even you! Do you actually have the ability to learn the skill or are you one of those who are just following the latest trends? If you are then give it up now. Why is alchemy so important? Huh.. you don't know anything do you? I'll teach you its great power! But before I do that, I need a metamorphosis potion. Create and bring me 1 deer metamorphosis potion with the alchemy skill that you've just learned. You'll need to get the necessary materials by yourself!	I just want to see your alchemy skills! Please make and bring me 1 deer metamorphosis potion.	Well, let's see. Hmm.. Not bad at all. You've made a very high standard metamorphosis potion!

Well, because you can transform into a monster, which will allow you to exhibit greater power than your normal combat strength. Obviously this will give you a great advantage in combat. You don't believe me do you? Well then try it out for yourself! I'll tell you what to do. We need some materials for alchemy, but the Lizardmen are preventing us from doing this. Please catch 15 Lizardman soldiers that appear in the Miracle Fountain vicinity. Well, of course by transforming into a deer, you'll understand what I mean!	You turn into a deer when you drink the deer metamorphosis potion! So when you're a deer, kill 15 Lizardman soldiers in the Miracle Fountain vicinity.	How was it? Did you experience the effect? The metamorphosis potions can be very useful in some instances so learn the skill, and don't be lazy! Learning one more skill can be very helpful in this terrible world!

This village is a small but cozy place which may not seem that special, but has the longest history of all the Orc villages. If you want to follow the spirits of your ancestors and travel around the Chantra continent, there are things that you need to know first. I'd like to tell you about the most basic residents here. There are residents that all of the travelers need to meet. I'm going to introduce you to a merchant. Please go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village. He will teach you about the kind of things that he does.	You will be meeting that merchant frequently during the course of your journey so why don't you take the time to get to know him better? Go and visit Merchant Zion in the center of the village	You were sent by the elder! He's always very kind, introducing the new travelers to the merchants. By doing that he's actually following the guidance of the Elements. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who battle monsters look for most of the time. Getting these from the monsters has its limits so they tend to buy a lot of potions whenever they come to see us. We do sell other various items though, not just potions, so please come around every now and then to check what we have. We're usually located in most places even in small villages.																																								1.

He doesn't do that much for the travelers but there is one thing that he does which we cannot do without. Please go and see him to find out what that is. Blacksmith Brin Ironmasher is in the northeast of the village.	You'll probably be able to meet merchants and blacksmiths wherever you go. Both merchants and blacksmiths are crucial for travelers' survival. Find Blacksmith Brin Ironmasher in the northeast of the village to find out more.	You're a traveler who was sent by Zion! Hmm, then I guess you'll have a lot of things that you're not sure about yet. When you start traveling around, you'll occasionally find a 'Reinforcement Potion'. Because this item is so rare, it's traded at a very high price in the auction houses. That potion itself is fairly useless, but a skilled blacksmith like me can use it to improve weapons and armor. Keep that in mind and don't forget to visit the blacksmith when you find a reinforcement potion. Ah, also please keep in mind that one reinforcement potion is consumed per use so think carefully before you decide to use the item.																																								1.

It's still worth finding out what he does directly from him, so please go and see Safe Keeper Tess in the west of the village.	You'll find out when you meet. Go and see Safe Keeper Tess in the west of the village.	You look like a new traveler. Do you have any items that you want me to look after for you? Oh, I see. If you are an Orc beginner, you have to show you're interested in finding out more about the village. It's a suicidal to just arrogantly jump into combat. You don't know how dangerous it is outside the gate! I'm starting to ramble on a bit. My job as the Safe Keeper is to keep the valuables safe. We keep travelers' items inside this box. There is a finite amount of space, but it's a good idea to keep the valuable items here. I heard that you can loot other travelers' items after killing them, so if you don't want this to happen to you, it would be a good idea to leave the items with a Safe Keeper like me.																																								1.

You'll have opportunities to meet the merchants specific to certain classes in the future. First though, you'll need to know about the item trader. Go and see Item Trader Morien who is in front of the village.	Some travelers will claim that they don't really need help from the item traders, but the traders play an important role in helping this continent to run more smoothly. Go and see Item Trader Morien who is in front of the village.	You are a new face in this village, aren't you? Then I doubt that you have any items that can trade? A safe keeper introduced you to me?

The chief sent you to us because it is essential that you know us. There are people like the chief wherever you go who represent their village, but they tend to grant more quests than anyone else because they know more of what goes on. So pay attention to the chiefs wherever you go. Now let's stop this chit chat, go and find Elder Brusoto in the central village.	Everyone has their own stories so you can receive quests from many people. But, what I'm trying to say is that you should pay more attention to the chiefs because they are the ones with most of the quests. Now, go and find Elder Brusoto in the center of the village.	So you've met all of the merchants then? Remember, even though they won't be able to help you on the battlefields, without them you can't expect your life and assets to be protected.

As you may know already, this village is located in a secluded place, so the connection with the outside is minimal. The journey that you're going to take now is very different from the comfortable life you had here. If you want to get used to the traveling, then there are so many things that you need to know. The most basic of that knowledge is knowing the kind of skills that are helpful to you. I'll tell you about them. I'd like to introduce a merchant to you among others the travelers commonly meet. Please go and find Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village. He will tell you the details about what he does.	Merchants can be a travelers best friend. So, learn about them while you have the chance. Visit Merchant Giridium who is located in the south east of the village.	You were sent by the Elder! He's always very kind to introduce new travelers to the Merchants. Life and Mana potions are the things that travelers who hunt monsters need the most. Getting them from the monsters can often result in deficient supplies during the heat of battle, so they tend to buy a lot every time they come and visit us. We also buy and sell various other items so come back to visit any time. Let's help each other out!																																								1.

To find out what that is, go and ask the Blacksmith Ayre in the west of the village will be waiting for you.	You'll be able to meet Merchants and Blacksmiths wherever you go. These people are very important to the travelers. If you want to know the reason, please go and see Blacksmith Ayre in the west of the village.	Oh, you're a new traveler? Then you still have much to learn. You will occasionally obtain a 'Reinforcement Potion' during the course of your travel. The likelihood of obtaining the Reinforcement Potion is very low so they are often traded at a very price in the auction house. The Potion on its own is completely useless but through a Blacksmith like me, it becomes a very valuable tool to upgrade your weapons and armor. Oh, another thing. One bottle is consumed per use, so remember to use them with discretion.																																								1.

It will be better to talk to him in person to find out what he does in more detail. Go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village.	You'll know when you meet him. Please go and find Safe Keeper Firnelli in the center of the village	A Safe Keeper keeps your deposits safe (as our name would suggest). The size of the depository is limited so you can't keep putting things in there indefinitely. It is a good idea to keep valuable items here. I heard that others can take your items if you are defeated in battle, so if you don't want that to happen, it would be best to leave the items with me in advance.																																								1.

Please go and find Item Trader Ferde in South East of the village.	Some travelers don't really seem to need item traders, but they play an important role in making the continent run more smoothly. Please go and talk to the Item Trader Ferde in southeast of the village.	I haven't seen you before You don't have any items that I can trade do you? You were sent here by the Safe Keeper? Well, if you want to enjoy your travel, it's a good idea to get to know me. Travelers trade items with each other through item traders like myself. There are all sorts of items at various prices. If you're lucky you might be able to get some items at a lower price than the general merchants. You can register an item from your own inventory. You can see the 'Sell' button below on your inventory can't you? So if you place the item in one of the slots that appear when you press 'Sell', the item is automatically registered on our trader's sale list.

The Elder sent you to us because it is important to get to know the essential residents like us first. Now, go back to the elder. There are people like the Elder in every village you go to. They are the ones who know most about what goes on in the village, so they tend to grant more quests than anyone else. Pay attention to the chiefs or elders wherever you go. Well, let's stop this chit chat. Go and find Elder Bosren in the north of the village.	Quests are not always granted by the elders. But pay attention to the elders and chiefs as they tend to have the most quests in that village. Go and see Elder Bosren in the North of the village	So you've met all of the merchants? Remember, even though they may not be able to help you in the battlefield, they can be useful allies. Visit the villages or cities regularly and build up a solid relationship with them.
